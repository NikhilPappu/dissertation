  review = {Shows a steer torque measurement system constructed for the UCSB instrumented
	bicycle but with little extra information. They use a linear force
	transducer of some sort mounted on the handlebars.
	
	
	They first show the point mass model like Karnopp's 2004 model (older
	ones are referenced in Meijaard2007). They stablize the steer angel
	to roll angle transfer function with a negative feedback gain which
	has dependence on the forward velocity.
	
	
	He adds a basic model of the front fork geometry to the point mass
	model, giving a relationship between steer torque input and steer
	angle which is speed dependent. The roll angle to steer angle now
	has a builtin negative feedback law due to the front fork geometry
	and if the k2 gain is large enough (with steer torque = 0) the system
	is stable. He uses this to calculat a critical velocity for stability.
	
	
	Klein says you should grip the handlebars lightly to take advantage
	of the bicycle self stability. This corresponds to the differences
	in the Whipple model and one with arms.
	
	
	Cites Wier1972 as giving 0.1s and 0.3s of nueromuscular delay in steer
	torque and upper body lean, respectively.
	
	
	The gyroscopic effects give rise to derivative feedback.
	
	
	Claims that riders use variation in forward speed as an additional
	control variable.},

	an unscented Kalman filter for estimation purposes, since it is based
	on a numerically efficient nonlinear stochastic estimation technique.
	A planar two-track model is combined with the empiric Magic Formula
	in order to describe the vehicle and tyre behaviour. Moreover, an
	advanced vertical tyre load calculation method is developed that
	additionally considers the vertical tyre stiffness and increases
	the estimation accuracy. Experimental tests show good accuracy and

  note = {STI-P-323},
  abstract = {This paper reflects on 25 years (or more) of handling quality research
	and shares with the reader some of the author's resulting experiences
	and thoughts. When reaching back so far and considering all that
	has been accomplished, there are many facets of handling or flying
	qualities which could be covered and considered. However, the author
	chooses to limit discussion to those aspects concerned with the theory
	of handling qualities, in turn relating to closed-loop, pilot-vehicle,
	frequency-domain analysis and its application to handling and flight
	control problems. This is not to deny other aspects of handling qualities
	research which are beyond the scope of this limited exposition, such
	as: ground and in flight simulation; rating systems; optimal control
	operator models; workload concepts; and data collection and codification.
	Rather, it is to emphasize those aspects that the author is personally
	most familiar with, and which stress the design guidance role of
	handling qualities theory and practice. This has always been important
	and it is especially important now because of increasing dependence
	on sophisticated flight control systems which can completely alter
	the way an airplane responds to the pilot's inputs. In fact, handling
	quality research has recently come up for its share of criticism
	as being inadequate to cope with some of today's design problems.
	For example, Berry, in a recent article in Astronautics and Aeronautics
	and Gibson, in a paper before the AGARD Conference in Fort Worth,
	both decried the fact that there have been a rash of generic handling
	problems associated with high-performance aircraft having sophisticated
	flight control systems, and that such systems have not always reached
	their full potential to provide handling qualities superior to much
	simpler aircraft of the past. Against this background, first to be
	discussed are the basic aspects of handling or flying qualities and
	some of the early design problems that were solved; then, the growth
	of handling qualities theory in response to design demands; and,
	finally, how that theory has been applied and expanded over the years
	to become a valuable tool, especially useful in coping with new situations
	such as those that seem to be occurring almost daily.},

	A bicycle is an unmanned system that is inherently unstable and its
	remote control is impossible without the existence of an embedded
	controller.
	
	
	It was in this spirit that a digital controller was developed to monitor
	the human pilot. The pilot and the controller is a single entity.
	A subsumption architecture style was developed in the heart of it
	a fuzzy controller can monitor the balance of the bike as it moves.
	The fuzzy controller is constructed starting from the identification
	of a servo adjustable gain control which allowed a stable bike.
	
	
	Other notes from Ryan reading it and telling me what it meant:
	
	
	- They did build the prototype of the model.
	
	- A rate gyro measure roll rate.
	
	- They compare the output of their fuzzy controller model with the
	actual output of the servo motor driven with the model for a good
	match.
	
	- They show some time history traces of the servo motor, gyro, and
	speed, but I'm not sure this was during an actual stablization run
	or if it was just bench testing. I think it was bench testing.},

	- that is, motion produced as a function of steering torque - and
	are closely related to ease of use and handling. This paper describes
	the measurement of the transfer functions of a typical sports motorcycle,
	resulting from data collected in slalom tests. These functions are
	then compared to analytical transfer functions derived from known
	models in the literature. The comparison shows fair to good agreement.
	Lastly, the formation of steering torque is analysed and the observed
	transfer functions are interpreted in this framework. It is shown
	that gyroscopic effects are mostly responsible for the lag between
	steering torque and roll angle, and that there is a velocity for
	which the various terms that combine to form steering torque cancel
	each other out, yielding a Âmaximum gain condition' for torque to
	roll transfer function which drivers rated Âgood handling'.},

  review = {JKM - Biral et al. designed a custom steer torque measurement system
	using a cantilever beam. They don't specifically discuss the cross
	talk, but do mention that they use a half-bridge strain gauge. This
	design seems that it could be susceptible to cross talk from the
	forces applied to the handlebars by the rider. But they also report
	experimental values for torque that match model predictions very
	well. The measure torques from -20 to 20 Nm for a slalom maneuver
	at 13 m/s.
	
	
	They computed roll angle by integrating their roll rate measurements.
	To account for drift the motorcycle travel on straight sections at
	the beginning and end of each run.
	
	
	They ran the motorcycle through slaloms and examined the very sinosodial
	data during the slalom part of the maneuver. They did a variety of
	slaloms by changing cone spacing and varying the motorcycles speed.
	This gave data points at multiple frequencies. Speeds ranged from
	2.5 to 27.2 m/s. (Their example graph is at 40 m/s??) The cone spacing
	was 7m, 14m, and 21m.
	
	
	They do not account for the inertial affects of the handlebars.
	
	
	They compare three experimental and three model tranfer functions
	(they use both one of Sharp's models and one of Lot's). Sharp's 1971
	model is one of the earlier motorcycl models and the Lot one is more
	modern with extra stuff added in. These are interesting Bode plots
	because they aren't plotted for a constant speed, but for constant
	cone spacing. Since cone spacing is proportional to frequency with
	respect to speed you can make these plots. This is good because it
	is difficult to do experiments at exact repeatable speeds. They point
	out that there is a peak torque to roll angle amplitude ratio at
	about 7 m/s for all cone spacings. They also say that the riders
	give better handling ratings at this speed.
	
	
	The steer angle to yaw rate transfer function is quite linear until
	speeds where sideslip starts to matter. The linear part slope only
	depends on wheelbase and cone spacing.
	
	
	The Lot model seems to fit generally better than the Sharp model,
	though both fit pretty well (by eye). It would be great if they provided
	some statisics on how well the fits were. They could have also done
	this with system id techniques instead of fitting sinusoids to the
	data.
	
	
	They use a Nyquist plot to show why there is a "large" descrepancy
	in the phase of the roll/steer torque transfer function 7m graph.
	It just happens that the path of the experimental data passes through
	an opposite quadrant as the theorectical, so the phase has drastic
	change. But they are actually similar.
	
	
	Lot's model seems to be all numerical.
	
	
	They talk a bit about the contributions to steering torque and how
	the tires are biggest contributor.
	
	
	They point out that fitting a sinusoid to a non-linear simulation
	and plotting the point just as they did with experimental data it
	doesn't fall on the linear Bode plot line. Some of the error is explained
	by there fitting procedure and using a linear model.},

  review = {JKM - These guys propose two methods to estimate the roll angle of
	the motorcycle using only gyros and vehicle speed: ``speed-based''
	and``gyro-base''. The ``speed-based'' approach seems like it could
	be appropriate for our project, as it only requires measuring the
	roll and yaw body fixed rates and the wheel rate. The gyro-based
	is more detailed to incorporate the slope and bank angle of the roads,
	which we will not need. The accuracy of the method isn't super high,
	definitely not compared to measuring the roll angle with a mechanical
	device or maybe even motion capture. They say the peak estimation
	errors for roll angle are 5 degrees. They split the rate measurements
	into high and low frequency components because the low frequency
	contains the DC drift noise. A parameter is chosen for the low pass
	filter as low as possible to split the frequency signals. The high
	frequency estimated versus laser measured had a 0.05 error-to-signal
	ratio. They use a force balance equation (12) and warping function
	to estimate the low freq roll angle component. They tuned the warping
	function by performing steady state cornering tests and using system
	ID tools to fit a curve. The gyro-based rate is used to include road
	slope and bank angle. If the accuracy of 5 percent is good enough
	for our measurements this may be a good way to do things, but it
	requires having a way to measure roll angle of the bike for calibration
	purposes. This could be done by borrowing some distance lasers, using
	motion capture or building a mechical roll angle measurement device
	in the lab.
	
	
	Other things to note: 
	
	- they claim that there are drive-by-wire motorcycles, should look
	this up
	
	- check out SAFEBIKE http://safebike.jku.at

	- they used 4 one-axis gyros with a 10hz cutoff frequency
	
	- they used a 100-step encoder wheel for wheel rate measurement
	
	- they claim the laser sensors' measurement error is on average less
	than 1 degree
	
	- they adjusted for misalignment in mounting the gyros by riding straight
	for 10s to calibrate
	
	- equation 15 shows how the roll angle is different for tordial tires
	
	- they should have taken better care to align the gyros properly
	
	
	DLP -- Two optical distance sensors were mounted to the rear passenger
	foot pegs, so that lean angle can be determined by the formula phi
	= arctan( (z_1 - z_2) / L), where $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the distance
	readings from either sensor to the ground, and L is the constant
	distance between the two sensors. Pitching motions of the frame would
	affect this measurement although this effect would only be second
	order. For the large lean angles obtained by a motorcycle, $50^\circ
	- 55^\circ$, it seems like the pitching motion would be non negligble.
	Additionally, four single axis rate gyroscopes were mounted to the
	main frame of the motorcycle. The details of how they were mounted
	and aligned is not mentioned, but presumably the had one aligned
	with the longitudinal axis (to measure roll rate) and one with the
	vertical axis (to measure yaw rate), both when the motorcycle is
	in the upright zero steer configuration. The other two rate gyros
	were aligned with axes that were initially aligned with the yaw measurement
	axis, then rotated $\pm45^\circ$ about the longitudinal axis. These
	additional gyroscopes were used in their alternative LF roll angle
	estimation method.\\
	
	
	I wonder why the complete kinematic differential equations of the
	motorcycle are not used to integrate and determine the actual coordinates.
	If the $u_i = \omega^D \cdot d_i$, where $d_i$ are the three body
	fixed coordinates ($d_2$ out of plane of symmetry, $d_3$ aligned
	with steer axis, $d_1 = d_2 \times d_3$) of the bicycle frame, then
	the kinematic differential equations are:\\
	
	$\dot{q}_1=-(s_3/c_2) u_1 + (c_3/c_2) u_3$\\
	
	$\dot{q}_2=c_3 u_1 + s_3 u_3$\\
	
	$\dot{q}_3=s_3 t_2 u_1 + u_2 - c_3 t_2 u_3$\\
	
	Where $q_1$ is the yaw, $q_2$ is the roll, and $q_3$ is the pitch.
	I guess probably the linearization is plenty accurate and the nonlinear
	equations needn't be used, especially for the roll angle differential
	equation. For the yaw angle differential equation, it seems like
	you could safely linearize in pitch, but maybe not lean. I wonder
	if drift in the estimated roll angle could be due to kinematic approximations
	such as these.\\
	
	
	The filter they used was a digital low pass filter with unity gain
	at DC (s=0 <==> z=1): $(1-a) / (1 - a/z)$. The signal from the gyroscope
	was filtered, then subtracted the original to determine the high
	frequency component of roll rate, which was then integrated to estimate
	roll angle. One confusing thing that is not mentioned is that the
	optical sensor measures distance, and they talk about the high frequency
	component of the true roll angle as measured by the optical encoder,
	but they don't say if they used the exact same procedure with the
	*roll angle from the optical sensors* as they did with the *roll
	angle RATE from the rate gyroscope* -- i.e., did they just filter
	the roll angle signal from the optical sensors and then subtract
	it from the original roll angle in order to determine the HF "true"
	roll angle? Also missing from the paper was an analog to figure 10
	for the LF component from both the optical sensors and the rate gyros.\\
	
	
	The exact sensors they used were never mentioned. This would be nice
	and we should contact them to find this out.\\},

  abstract = {To provide a scientific basis for the design of bicycle pedals which
	possibly alleviate over-use knee injuries, two hypotheses were tested
	in the present study. The two hypotheses were: (1) that the three-dimensional
	pedal constraint loads; and (2) that the three-dimensional intersegmental
	knee loads would be reduced more significantly by a foot/pedal platform
	allowing both adduction/abduction and inversion/eversion rotations
	simultaneously than by a platform which allowed either rotation individually.
	To test these hypotheses, pedal load and lower limb kinematic data
	were collected from 10 subjects who pedaled with four pedal platforms
	which allowed zero, one, and two degrees of freedom. A number of
	quantities describing both pedal loads and intersegmental knee loads
	was computed for each of the four pedal platforms using a previously
	reported biomechanical model. The quantities included the positive
	and negative extremes, averages, and areas, as well as the total
	absolute area and RMS. Quantities were compared using analysis of
	variance techniques. The key results were that there were significant
	reductions in the coupled nondriving moments at the pedal for the
	dual-rotation platform compared to each of the single-rotation cases.
	The significant reductions in the coupled moments at the pedal were
	not manifest at the knee. However, a general nonsignificant reduction
	in both coupled knee moments was evident. Also, the valgus knee moment
	was significantly reduced by the dual-rotation platform compared
	to the inversion/eversion only design. Although the axial knee moment
	was not significantly reduced by the dual-rotation platform over
	the adduction/abduction design, there was a general nonsignificant
	reduction. The lack of significance in knee load results occurred
	because of high intersubject variability. Accordingly, load reduction
	benefits made by introducing the second degree of freedom need to
	be considered individually.},

	rotations provided estimates of the proprioceptive weighting factor,

	the sensory-reweighting hypothesis is true, then the decline in Wp
	should be accompanied by a corresponding increase in Wg, the graviceptive
	weighting factor, and responses to the GVS should increase in proportion
	to the value of Wg derived from responses to SS rotations. Results
	were consistent with the predictions of the proposed sensory-reweighting

	Modeling, analysis, and control of bicycle dynamics has been an attractive

	Bicycle dynamics has attracted the attention of the automatic control

	example, the fact that it depends strongly on the bicycle speed and
	that, under certain conditions, it exhibits both open right-half
	plane poles and zeros, making the design of feedback controllers

	the LPV nature of the bicycle dynamics is exploited to design a control
	system that automatically balances a riderless bicycle in the upright

	He uses an eleven generalized coordinate model he developed in Chen2006
	which is nonlinear to generate simulation results. He simulates with
	a roll angle controller so that non stable speeds can be studied.
	He uses his fuzzy logic controller to stablize the bicycle. He also
	adds an additive random signal to the controller output to give more
	excitation to steer torque. He uses the benchmark bicycle parameters
	for the simulations.
	
	
	He uses the pem function in matlab to identify the non-zero and non-unity
	entries of the A and B matrices of a fourth order model with one
	input and two outputs representing Whipple model. He then open loop
	simulates the identified model with the steer torque used to generate
	the non-lin sim data for that run. He does this for a series of speeds
	from 1 to 15 m/s. I'm curious why he didn't do less than 1 m/s. This
	allows him to plot the eigenvalues of the identified systems as a
	function of speed. The eigenvalue plot has some differences from
	the one in Meijaard2007. This could be due to the fact that his nonlinear
	model is incorrect. But if it is correct, He finds that capsize mode
	has this blip that goes briefly unstable before the stable speed
	range. There is general roughness in the curves too, they don't seem
	to be super continous from the plot from 0 to 15, but maybe if the
	resolution was better.
	
	
	He plots some limit cycles of his non-linear model at 3.5 m/s which
	is this funny speed where he found the capsize mode to go unstable.
	I don't know what he is trying to get at here. Figure 4 seems to

	anedoctal introduction to bicycle dynamics. They did some basic experiments
	by attaching a torque wrench to a bicycle and made left at right
	turns at speeds from 0 to 13 m/s (0 to 30mph). The torques were under
	5Nm except for the 13 m/s trial which read about 20 Nm. They designed
	a pretty nice compac torque measurement setup by mounting the handlebars
	on bearings and using a linear force transducer to connect the handlbars
	to the steer tube which reduced the effects of other moments and
	forces acting on the steer tube. The use of bearings and rodends
	may be questionable as there is bearing friction and slop. Furthermore,
	downward forces on the handlebars could possibly still be transmitted
	to the load cell. The design does allow one to choose the lever arm
	for the load cell, thus giving some choice to amplify the force signal.
	They set it up to measure from 0 to 84 Nm with a Model SM Series
	S-type load cell from Interface with a 670 Newton range. They used
	a transducer amplifier also for signal conditioning. There are several
	sections on calibration, with some description of the use of pulleys
	and cables to apply a torque to the handlebars. They measured the
	torque during two different manuever types: a sharp turn at various
	angles and steady turns on various diameter circles both at 10mph
	(4.5 meters/second). The rider maintained constant speed through
	visual feedback of a speedometer. He talks of very noisy measurements
	and filters the noise by some type of moving average. He does not
	identify an countersteering. He claims the rider turns the handle
	bars right to initiate a right turn. There seems to be no counter-torque
	in the data for turns. For the sharp turns the highest reported torque
	is about 10 Nm, for the steady turning he reports the highest average
	torque as 1 Nm.},

	The response to angle and torque overlay inputs to the steering system

	reduced the disturbing effect of torque overlay and angle overlay
	inputs. Reflex action reduced the disturbing effect of a torque overlay
	input, but increased the disturbing effect of an angle overlay input.
	Experiments on a driving simulator showed that measured handwheel
	angle response to an angle overlay input was consistent with the
	response predicted by the model with reflex action. However, there

	very low centre of gravity that the pedalling cadence can affect
	the riderÂs ability to control the vehicle. To understand the relationship
	between cadence and bicycle stability, a multibody dynamic model
	is created. This model has nine massive rigid bodies: the bicycle
	frame with fixed rider torso (with head & and arms), the front fork
	with handlebars, the front wheel, the rear wheel, the left thigh,
	the right thigh, the left shank with foot, the right shank with foot,
	and the cranks. Nonlinear equations of motion are compiled in Autolev,
	a symbolic calculator using KaneÂs method for multibody dynamics
	(Autolev, 2005). A simulation of the bicycle slowly accelerating
	from its starting speed (5 m/s) to its target speed (35 m/s) is run
	iteratively over several gear ratios. A steering controller is implemented
	to stabilize the bike outside its stable stable speed range. The
	simulation displays the lean and steer angles as well as steering
	control torque. Lean angle and control torque increase significantly
	with cadence, and steer angle increases slightly with cadence. This
	relationship is used to create a shifting strategy to reduce the
	control effort needed by the pilot during top top-speed speed-record
	attempts.},

	In particular, the weave mode shows large yaw and roll oscillations

	of vibration, since the mass, stiffness and damping of limbs modify
	the dynamic properties of the system; moreover, at low frequency
	the rider can control oscillations. There are few experimental results
	dealing with the response of the rider in the presence of large oscillations
	of the motorcycle. This lack is due to the difficulty of carrying
	out measurements on the road and of reproducing the phenomena in
	the laboratory. This paper deals with a research programme aimed
	at measuring the oscillations of the rider's body on a running motorcycle
	in the presence of weave. First, testing equipment is presented.
	It includes a special measurement device that is able to measure
	the relative motion between the rider and the motorcycle. Then the

	This quote is great "The old saw says that once learned it is never
	forgotten, but what exactly is learned has been by no means clear."
	
	
	His goal is to determine how much of the rider's control actions can
	be accounted for without involving higher cerebral functions. He
	mentions the Weir and Zellner work and the fact that it is about
	motorcycles and at high speed, then questions whether the control
	employed for their system is simply a different version of the one
	employed on a bicycle at low speed or different control methodologies
	all together. He mentions the arm and upper body movements and how
	it is difficult to tease out the delibirate movements verus the passive
	dynamics of the body.
	
	
	He doesn't seem to know about any bike self-stability as he claims
	that open-loop runs are virtually impossible, but then says that
	the autostability properties are woven with the human's dynamics.
	He says that "mathematical models are intolerant of inputs that have
	their origin ouside the system". He suggests removing upper body
	movement by using a brace.
	
	
	He eliminates the head angle, trail and front wheel gyro effect so
	that "all steer movements are a result of the human's control".
	
	
	He employs some kind of time step based calculation of the states
	where he can employ intermittent control and says that tuning the
	control values allows him to match the traces taken during the experiments.
	
	
	Since the system is so unstable this leaves the human little freedom
	of choice of which control system to use.
	
	
	He says that upper body leaning alone cannot exert control in the
	rolling plane.
	
	
	He describe countersteering, then says that it is clear that any desired
	heading changes have to be translated in into some form of demand
	to the lateral control system. i.e. to go right you must roll the
	frame right, to roll the frame right you must steer to initiate a
	righward roll.
	
	
	Figure 2 has uncanny resemblance to the control model we developed
	{Hess2012}. He only has on inner loop feeding back roll rate (we
	feed back steer angle, roll rate and roll angle) and says that is
	the essential loop a human must learn to control before being able
	to navigate and turn.
	
	
	It seems like he gets somewhat close matches from his control model
	to the real traces, but then adds in pulses (single or multiple)
	to the steering so that the traces matches more closely. This is
	done at first for a run where the rider goes into a steady turn and
	then out. This was done with a normal bicycle and he claimed there
	was no way to tease out the bicycle's auto stability from the traces.
	
	
	He blindfolds the subjects on the destabilized bicycle to prevent
	riders from trying to maintain direction but the riders seemed to
	go generally straight regardless.
	
	
	I need to reread the middle parts, I don't understand all his logic.
	
	
	He feeds back roll acceleration and integrates it to get roll angular
	velocity. This is basically a PD control on roll rate. These are
	continous. But he says that the roll angle control is discrete and
	uses a rule "Make a pulse against the lean whenever it gets bigger
	that 1.6 degrees."
	
	
	He says the gains are inversly proportional to speed.
	
	
	He cites the crossover model saying that humans can adjust their gain.
	
	
	He claims the balancing part of the control system is a lower cortex
	type of control.
	
	
	He never says what his computer simulation is. I guess it is detailed
	in his thesis. The graphs are poor and he never compares experiment
	to simulation directly.},

  title = {The Skill of Bicycle Riding},
  school = {Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield},
  year = {1987},
  abstract = {The principal theories of human motor skill are compared. Disagreements
	between them centre around the exact details of the feedback loops
	used for control. In order to throw some light on this problem a
	commonplace skill was analysed using computer techniques to both
	record and model the movement. Bicycle riding was chosen as an example
	because it places strict constraints on the freedom of the rider's
	actions and consequently allows a fairly simple model to be used.
	Given these constraints a faithful record of the delicate balancing
	movements of the handlebar must also be a record of the rider's actions
	in controlling the machine.
	
	
	An instrument pack, fitted with gyroscopic sensors and a handlebar
	potentiometer, recorded the roll, yaw and steering angle changes
	during free riding in digital form on a microcomputer disc. A discrete
	step computer model of the rider and machine was used to compare
	the output characteristic of various control systems with that of
	the experimental subjects. Since the normal bicycle design gives
	a measure of automatic stability it is not possible to tell how much
	of the handlebar movement is due to the rider and how much to the
	machine. Consequently a bicycle was constructed in which the gyroscopic
	and castor stability were removed. In order to reduce the number
	of sensory contributions the subjects were blindfolded.
	
	
	The recordings showed that the basic method of control was a combination
	of a continuous delayed repeat of the roll angle rate in the handle-bar
	channel, with short intermittent ballistic acceleration inputs to
	control angle of lean and consequently direction.
	
	
	A review of the relevant literature leads to the conclusion that the
	proposed control system is consistent with current physiological
	knowledge. Finally the bicycle control system discovered in the experiments
	is related to the theories of motor skills discussed in the second
	chapter.},

  review = {He choose the bicycle balance task instead of smaller simpler tasks
	that could be synthesized into a more complex task. He sees the bicycle
	as allowing only a few stragteiges for its operation and this is
	an advantage.
	
	
	The principal control stragety for roll velocity is continous but
	there is strong evidence that intermitent movements are superimposed
	onto this stragtegy to control the angle of lean. I could imagine
	that his simulation model wasn't good enough to simulate the closed
	loop system without these corrective actions, I'm unsure whether
	the evidence for them is sound.
	
	
	pg55 He doesn't see much use in the traditional open-loop bicycle
	modeling techinques and claims that it is virtually impossible to
	specifiy a truly open-loop modle because the riders arms are on teh
	bars and have a inherent muscle action (tonus).
	
	
	pg60 The inertia of the rider was modeled as a single cylinder. The
	bicycle was diassembled, weighed and measured. He averaged the weight
	of the two subjects for simulation. He considerd the bicycle to be
	a flat plate for inertia calcs. Basically, very crude estimates of
	the inertia where made.
	
	
	Used a tire model : "more angle gives more force" I assume this is
	the slip angle ratio.
	
	
	His method of develop the "equations of motion" is very different
	from a typical engineering approach. I'd be quick to dismiss it,
	but he ends up with some kind of simulation that seems to act like
	a bicycle and even has speed dependent autostability.
	
	
	pg83 on the autostability: "No test of the real bike was made at this
	speed al though the author heard a first-hand account from an owner
	who, as a result of a bet, pushed his riderless bicycle down a steep
	hill and it ran upright to the bottom."
	
	
	He used a rate gyro for roll and yaw rates. He used a potentiometer
	for steer angle, geared down with a rubber o-ring band (which had
	slipping problems). He had a speed measuring device, but opted to
	compute the mean speed over the length of the run by recording the

  abstract = {People have been successfully building and riding bicycles since the
	1800s, and many attempts have been made to describe the motion of
	these machines mathematically. However, common acceptance of the
	correct linearized equations of motion for a bicycle has remained
	elusive. In his 1988 masterÂs thesis at Cornell University, Scott
	Hand derived the equations again and performed the first known extensive
	survey of the literature, finding and documenting the mistakes made
	in previous attempts. The question remained however of what mistakes,
	if any, Mr. Hand and his advisors made. The subsequent advent of
	cheap and plentiful computing power and the development of numerical
	methods to take advantage of it provide an opportunity to confirm,
	once and for all, the correct linearized equations of motion for
	an idealized bicycle. That is exactly what A. L. Schwab, J. P. Meijaard,
	and J. M. Papadopoulos have done in their recent paper. The next
	step is to efficiently promulgate these correct and confirmed equations
	in a useful form. The goal is that anyone working in the areas of
	bicycle or motorcycle handling or control can use these equations
	directly or verify their own underlying equations against this benchmark.
	This thesis describes a program, JBike6, its on-line help, and its
	web site designed specifically for that purpose: to provide a turn-key
	application for evaluating the self-stability of a bicycle. JBike6
	also generates numbers (eigenvalues and matrix entries) that can
	be used to compare, to very high precision, against any other linearized
	or fully non-linear equations of motion for a bicycle. After a brief
	review of the application, theory, and results of JBike6, the contents
	of this thesis consist primarily of hard copy of the on-line help
	and web site and screen shots of the program. The text has been modified
	to be more readable as a narrative and some pictures have been formatted
	to fit within the margins. Obviously, the interactive nature of the

	of a stable speed range, below which the weave mode is unstable,
	above which the capsize mode is slightly unstable.\\
	
	
	Discussion of a steering damper is included, and it is mentioned that
	it is more important that a steering damper prevent handlebar shimmy

  review = {He does a nice review of the current work. He chooses Sharp's model
	as the most definitive motorcycle model and works with it. He shows
	the classic compensatory manual control system. He then shows the
	crossover model citing that a suprising amount of experimental data
	supports the model. He cites Weir as good manual control work and
	talks about how van Lunteren and Stassen's simulator may not be very
	realistic. He says that the van Lunteren and Stassen work was based
	on the Whipple model which hadn't be verified against experiment
	and points out the steer angle and lean angle inputs not being torques.
	He cite a bicycle simulator by Hattori in Japan, which I haven't
	heard of.
	
	
	He does two experiment sets: transient response of the uncontrolled
	motorcycle and roll stablization of the controlled motorcycle
	
	
	Figure 1.1 shows that for speeds below 30 mph the tire slip models
	do not vary much from a model without tireslip.
	
	
	He shows Sharp's simple tire relaxation forumla.
	
	
	He points out that stability may not always be desireable for the
	rider.
	
	
	"For motorcycles, steering-torque control is more likely than position
	control, due to the greatly increase instability of the capsize mode
	whne the steering degree of freedom is omitted."
	
	
	He and Weir independentely substantiated Sharp's model. Eaton's roots
	were identical to Sharps. He uses five bodies: engine, rear wheel,
	rear frame and rider, front frame and front wheel. he linearizes
	about the upright (except for coulomb headtube friction). Point contact
	wheels but he includes tire forces and moments due to slip and inclination.
	Figure's 2.1-2.3 show nice comparisons of the root loci with respect
	to speed for different tire models. He concludes that 1) path-curvature
	effects primarily influence the wobbl mode, 2) tire moments have
	an importnat influence on the cpaise mode and 3) the weave mode is
	influenced by the choice of a tire model only when speeds are below
	20 mph.
	
	
	Insturmented motorcycle: The rider's upper body was rigidified with
	a brace. He did hands-off experiments with the brace!! He used a
	third wheel to measure roll angle. Yaw rate was measured with gyro.
	Roll angle and steer angle were measured with potentiometers. They
	used a chased car with the measurement equipment, including strip
	charts. 
	
	
	Uncontrolled experiments:
	
	He excited steering by the rider applying an impulsive tap to the
	handlebars. He excited roll by hanging weights on teh motorcycle
	and then dropping one of the weights to apply a gravity based roll
	torque. He found that the weights didn't change the resultin gveritcal
	loads on the tires and coudl be neglected. He used the rate gyro
	to measure roll rate in the hand controlled experiments. He found
	it difficult to independently excite the motorcycle modes of motion
	with high speed wobble being the easiest to excite and capsize and
	weave being difficult. He did a combo excitation too: drop the weight
	and apply steer torque impulse to correct the fall.
	
	
	He compares simulation results for the combo excitation claiming to
	clearly see the wobble mode (except in roll angle), not seeing weave
	(due to high damping) and clearly seeing capsize at the two top speed
	runs. Figures 3.2-3.5 show ok agreement, with the higher 42 mph run
	showing most agreement. He did many tests, with little variablity.
	Wobble predicting decreased with speed. He sees constant damping
	and freq of the wobble mode with respect to speed.
	
	
	Other uncontrolled experiments:
	
	1. The test vehicle seemed to be unstable at all speeds.
	
	2. No low freq weave coudl be excited. He observed natural steer into
	the fall but it wasn't fast enough for enough correction.
	
	3. Instability became less severe as speed increased.
	
	
	He found no evidence that any of his tire models were any better than
	his #1 model (lateral slip and inclination forces and aligning moments
	from slip angles).
	
	
	He goes through several hypotheses about why the the model doesn't
	match his experiments well, focusing on more complicated tire models
	and their effects at lower speeds. he concludes that he needs a better
	tire model at low speeds.
	
	
	Chapter 4: man-machine system
	
	
	He focues on the roll stablization inner loop. Feedback roll angle
	and control based on roll angle error. He eliminates body lean control
	as an option to simplify things. He does note that low speed and
	difficult manuevers may require body lean. He calculates the transfer
	functions from steer torque to roll for the open loop motorcycle
	at 15, 30 and 45 mph based on his measured parameters. Figure 4.2
	shows the bode plots of each. The 30 and 45 Bode plots are almost
	the same and the 15 is very different. (15 mph is stable). The rider
	can control frequencies less than 10 rad/s. The 15 mph is dominated
	by weave and capsize, while the higher speeds are dominated by capsize
	alone. 15 is aproximated by 3rd order and the 30, 45 are approximated
	by a first order transfer function. This leads to a simple form of
	the human operator for the 30, 45 mph speeds: a simple gain and time
	delay. He focues on 30 mph for remaining analysis.
	
	
	He measured steer torque with a torque bar and the rider could only
	use one hand. He set up his strain gages and bar design to be primarily
	senstive to the applied steer torque. The roll angle sensor was not
	always reliable. He filtered all signals with a first order filter
	with break freqency of 5 rad/s.
	
	
	He identifies the controlled element with two methods: cross-spectral
	and impulse response methods. The impulse response method is finite
	impulse response using linear regression. he notes that the remnant
	is an issue and makes use of the Wingrove Edwards method to reduce
	the error in estimating the rider. There is a time delay where the
	autocorrelation function of the remnant is minimized. This time delay
	can be leveraged to remove much of the error in identifying the human
	controller.
	
	
	* you can use a Pade approximation to time delay to linearize the
	model in identification *
	
	
	Chapter 6: Roll stablization experiments
	
	
	These are basically the same as Eaton1973a, which I've alread reviewed.
	He sees 3 to 5 time larger steer angles at 15 mph than 30+ mph, but
	steer torques increase with speed. Roll angles and rates were nearly
	speed independent. He found a dominant frequency between 1.5 and
	5.0 rad/s.
	
	
	He says that the motorcycle equations of motion are good predictors
	now, but the conclusions from Chapter 3 seemed like they were more
	mediocre. He shows much better matches of the controlled element
	(the motorcycle) during these experiments (he's looking at smalle
	bandwidth). his fit is worse for the 15 mph runs, mainly for 1-2
	rad/s. He found that his roll angle measurement was better to work
	with than the roll rate (this was a limited of his id procedure).
	
	
	It looks like he decides to fix the time delay even though it was
	more variable: 0.14-0.21. He found the average for most days to be
	around 0.3, so he forced it to be 3.0 for the day and rider that
	didn't fit that. He had to fix the delat because any combination
	of the delay and lead equalization terms woudl give food fits (i.e.
	a flat spot in the linear regression??).
	
	
	He shows good matches to the crossover model for all speeds.
	
	
	Pg 134: A gain and time delay describe the rider block for higher
	speeds! "If the rider wishes to change the roll angle, he applies
	a steering torque to the handlebars of opposite sign to the direction
	of desired change." -- countersteering
	
	
	Conclusions:
	
	
	1. Sharp's model is good for weave and capsize prediction except at
	low speeds.
	
	2. The model doesn't describe wobble below 35 mph. A better tire model
	may be needed.
	
	3. No real stable speed range was found.
	
	4. His various tire models didn't improve fit results.
	
	5. Tire overturning moments and aligning torques cancel each other.
	
	6. Viscous steering dampers are prefered to Coulomb because the latter
	destablizes roll.
	
	
	1. The rider remnant excitation provides enough to identify the controlled
	element (no other external forces are needed)
	
	2. The time shift method can be used to identify the rider control
	block.
	
	3. The rider can be modeled as a simple gain and time delay for high
	speed runs. Th time delay was consistently 0.3 seconds.
	
	4. The rider can be described as a gain on rate control with lead
	equalization for 15 mph runs.
	
	5. The crossover model was valid for this data.
	
	6. The rider remnant is large and white.
	
	7. Phase margins: 30-50 degrees, gain margins: 4-11 db for the rider
	transfer function. A dominant frequency was between 1.5 to 5.0 rad/s.
	
	8. Body lean control was not necessary to control the motorcycle in
	normal riding. It may be more of a style thing if folks use it.
	
	
	Appendices
	
	
	A tire model.
	
	
	He measures the inertia with the rider on the bike in the brace. Roll
	inertia was measured by setting the bike on knife edge and osciallating
	it under springs. Yaw inertia was measured by suspending the bike
	from thr front and rear on strings and osciallating. The product
	of inertia was found the same a yaw but with the motorcycle tipped
	up. A torional pendulum was used for the wheels and fork. Engine
	inertia and mass was from manufacturer.
	
	
	He estimates the coloumb friction in the steering head with a break-away
	torque method (i.e. static friction), but says it was negligible.
	
	
	For some of the roll stabilization trials at 15 and 30 mph, he finds
	30 in-lb (3.4 Nm) to be the maximum steer torque.
	
	
	He shows the tire mounted in a tire tester. He measured all the tire
	forces and moments.},

  review = {He cites Sharp's 1971 model as the definitive model and uses it in
	his analysis. He augmented it with tire aligning moments due to sideslip.
	He questions the work done by van Lunteren and Stassen because they
	used a bicycle simulator and simplified equations of motion and their
	use of steer angle as the fundamental input to bicycle control. He
	likes Weir's theorectical work. His goal is to use experimental uses
	to corraborate Sharp and Weir's work.
	
	
	This paper is strictly about his roll stabilization experiments, Weir's
	inner most loop. His model has a human controller, motorcycle plant
	and two additive noise components, one for the rider remnant and
	the other for the wind and road disturbances.
	
	
	He instrumented a motorcycle to measure steer angle with a potentiometer,
	roll rate with a rate gyro, roll angle with a third wheel and steer
	torque with a custom load bar with a strain gage. He says that the
	effects of controlling throttle on the rear frame and steering with
	only one hand are surely smaller than the effects of using position
	control input versus torque control inputs (i.e. it is not a big
	deal that the rider is controllin steer with one hand). He had a
	brace to prevent torso movement. There was a chase car that carried
	the recording equipment.
	
	
	He had three experienced riders of approximately the same weight.
	He uses data from Rider A (himself) for 15 experiments, 3 of which
	were at 15 mph and the rest at 30 mph. Rider B and C did twelve and
	eleven runs at 30 mph, respectively.
	
	
	He says that the correlation between the output, roll angle, at a
	time, lambda, before the current time and the current human remnant
	is less than the correlation between the current roll angle and the
	current rider remnant. Lambda should be between 0 and the rider's
	time delay. He uses this assumption and the Wingrove-Edwards methods
	with a impulse response identification to determine the rider control
	block, Yp.
	
	
	He first identifies Yc, the motorcycle and says it can be estimated
	by find the cross spectrum between roll and steer torque over the
	power spectrum of steer torque. Figure 3 gives and example of this
	as compared to the Bode plot of the motorcycle model, with good agreement.
	The best agreement is is between 1-4 rad/s, which corresponds to
	the frequencies where most of the power of the roll angle and steer
	torque records are. He claims that since the motorcycle can be easily
	identified from the data the human remnant must be the dominant noise
	and the wind/road noise is negligible.
	
	
	He uses his identification method and finds that for the 30 mph tests
	the human can be represented by a simply gain and a time delay (few
	runs also had a significant lead equalization term). The 15 mph runs
	could be described by a gain, lead equalization, a time delay and
	a zero at the origin. He then says that the resulting rider/motorcycle
	transfer function takes the form of the crossover model.
	
	
	Table one shows identified parameters. The time delay is practically
	the same for all riders and all speeds. Rider A shows seemingly significant
	differences from one day to the next for the 30 mph runs.
	
	
	Figure 5 shows the identified human and motorcycle model transfer
	function for 30 mph tests for great fits to the cross over model.
	The 15 mph fit is great too, but uses the estimated motorcycle model
	instead of the first principles model.
	
	
	He says increasing amounts of lead equalization are needed by the
	human as speed decreases to fit the dictates of the crossover model.
	
	
	To at least 10 rad/s the human remnant was found to be white. The
	remnant includes rider steer torque non-linearly correlated to the
	output, non-linear path corrections, misc steering torques, time
	varitaion in the human block, and errors in identifying the human.
	The mean square remnant was a large propotion of the mean square
	steering torque.
	
	
	He measures the parameters of the motorcycle including tire properites
	on a tire testing machine.
	
	
	Conclusions:
	
	
	1. He could indentify the open loop motorcycle model.
	
	2. You can use the Wingrove-Edwards method to identify the rider block.
	
	3, 4. He can use a constant gain and time delay to model the rider
	for most runs, some required some lead equalization.
	
	5. He gets agreement with the crossover model.
	
	6. Most of the rider's steering torque was remnant. The power spectrum
	has similar shape as white noise run through the same filter.},

	system written in terms of dependent coordinates that are subject

	using symbolic computation. The DAE system is transformed to an ODE
	system written in terms of a minimum set of independent coordinates
	using the generalised coordinates partitioning method. This step
	is taken using numerical computation. The ODE system is then numerically
	linearised around the upright position and eigenvalue analysis of
	the resulting system is performed. The frequencies and modes of the
	bicycle are obtained as a function of the forward velocity which
	is used as continuation parameter. The resulting frequencies and
	modes are compared with experimental results. Finally, the non-linear
	equations of the bicycle are used to create an interactive real-time
	simulator using Matlab-Simulink. A series of issues on controlling
	the bicycle are discussed. The entire paper is focussed on teaching
	engineering students the practical application of analytical and
	computational mechanics using a model that being simple is familiar

  abstract = {The multibody dynamics analysis software, AUTOSIM, is used to develop
	automated linear and nonlinear models for the hand derived motorcycle
	models presented in (Sharp, 1971, 1994b). A more comprehensive model,
	based on previous work (Sharp and Limebeer, 2001), is also derived
	and extended. One version of the code uses AUTOSIM to produce a FORTRAN
	or C program which solves the nonlinear equations of motion and generates
	time histories, and a second version generates linearised equations
	of motion as a MATLAB file that contains the state-space model in
	symbolic form. Local stability is investigated via the eigenvalues
	of the linearised models that are associated with equilibrium points
	of the nonlinear systems. The time histories produced by nonlinear
	simulation runs are also used with an animator to visualise the result.
	A comprehensive study of the effects of acceleration and braking
	on motorcycle stability with the use of the advanced motorcycle model
	is presented. The results show that the wobble mode of a motorcycle
	is significantly destabilised when the machine is descending an incline,
	or braking on a level surface. Conversely, the damping of the wobble
	mode is substantially increased when the machine is ascending an
	incline at constant speed, or accelerating on a level surface. Except
	at very low speeds, inclines, acceleration and deceleration appear
	to have little effect on the damping or frequency of the weave mode.
	A theoretical study of the effects of regular road undulations on
	the dynamics of a cornering motorcycle with the use of the same model
	is also presented. Frequency response plots are used to study the
	propagation of road forcing signals to the motorcycle steering system.
	It is shown that at various critical cornering conditions, regular
	road undulations of a particular wavelength can cause severe steering
	oscillations. The results and theory presented here are believed
	to explain many of the stability related road accidents that have
	been reported in the popular literature. The advanced motorcycle
	model is improved further to include a more realistic tyre-road contact
	geometry, a more comprehensive tyre model based on Magic Formula
	methods utilising modern tyre data, better tyre relaxation properties
	and other features of contemporary motorcycle designs. Parameters
	describing a modern high performance machine and rider are also included.},

	motorcycle model whose parameter set is based on a Suzuki GSX-R1000

  abstract = {This paper studies the influence of road camber on the stability of
	single-track road vehicles. Road camber changes the magnitude and
	direction of the tire force and moment vectors relative to the wheels,
	as well as the combined-force limit one might obtain from the road
	tires. Camber-induced changes in the tire force and moment systems
	have knock-on consequences for the vehicle's stability. The study
	makes use of computer simulations that exploit a high-fidelity motorcycle
	model whose parameter set is based on a Suzuki GSX-R1000 sports machine.
	In order to study camber-induced stability trends for a range of
	machine speeds and roll angles, we study the machine dynamics as
	the vehicle travels over the surface of a right circular cone. Conical
	road surfaces allow the machine to operate at a constant steady-state
	speed, a constant roll angle, and a constant road camber angle. The
	local road-tire contact behavior is analyzed by approximating the
	cone surface by moving tangent planes located under the road wheels.
	There is novelty in the way in which adaptive controllers are used
	to center the vehicle's trajectory on a cone, which has its apex
	at the origin of the inertial reference frame. The results show that
	at low speed both the weave- and wobble-mode stabilities are at a
	maximum when the machine is perpendicular to the road surface. This
	trend is reversed at high speed, since the weave- and wobble-mode
	dampings are minimized by running conditions in which the wheels
	are orthogonal to the road. As a result, positive camber, which is
	often introduced by road builders to aid drainage and enhance the
	friction limit of four-wheeled vehicle tires, might be detrimental
	to the stability of two-wheeled machines.},

	to investigate in detail the dynamics characteristics and tyre characteristics
	during riding. Until now there has not been an adequate investigation
	conducted under a variety of riding conditions, but it is the aim
	of this research to show that it is possible to measure the tyre
	slip angle with a reasonable accuracy. It is our opinion that this
	will open a new path to a more detailed investigation of the motorcycle’s
	dynamics characteristics. In addition, we conducted measurements
	using not only the normal rider’s lean angle (lean-with posture),
	but also measurements in the case where the rider’s lean angle was
	intentionally changed, in order to investigate the effects that a
	change in the rider’s posture has on the variation in the measurement
	results of the motorcycle’s dynamics. Furthermore, we then compared
	these measurement results with the results obtained from simulations.
	Additionally, steering index values were calculated from the measurement
	results.},

	if one wishes to study complex modes of operation such as certain
	cornering phenomena. We establish the feasibility of using multi-body
	model building software to study the straight running properties
	of a motorcycle. Our results accurately match those found by Sharp
	[6], who hand derived the equations of motion, with the added advantage
	of a significant reduction in the time taken to model the system.
	Furthermore, we demonstrate the agreement between the results of
	the linear model and the time responses obtained from a small perturbation
	non-linear system derived by the multi-body package. We also contend
	that the probability of incorrectly modelling the system, using these
	software tools, is less than that found in manual methods. Three
	examples are given to demonstrate how these tools can reduce the
	time and effort needed in improving motorcycle design. Firstly, a
	motorcycle model is used to predict the change in stability resulting
	from changes in the mechanical trail. Then we show how this base
	model used by Sharp [6] can be extended to include bounce, pitch
	and suspension freedoms. Finally, we implement a simple rider control

  abstract = {Relying on a biomechanical model of the lower limb which treats the
	leg-bicycle system as a five-bar linkage constrained to plane motion,
	a cost function derived from the joint moments developed during cycling
	is computed. At constant average power of 200 W, the effect of five
	variables on the cost function is studied. The five variables are
	pedalling rate, crank arm length, seat tube angle, seat height, and
	longitudinal foot position on the pedal. A sensitivity analysis of
	each of the five variables shows that pedalling rate is the most
	sensitive, followed by the crank arm length, seat tube angle, seat
	height, and longitudinal foot position on the pedal (the least sensitive).
	Based on Powell's method, a multivariable optimization search is
	made for the combination of variable values which minimize the cost
	function. For a rider of average anthropometry (height 1.78 m, weight
	72.5 kg), a pedalling rate of 115 rev min-1, crank arm length of
	0.140 m, seat tube angle of 76Â°, seat height plus crank arm length
	equal to 97% of trochanteric leg length, and longitudinal foot position
	on the pedal equal to 54% of foot length correspond to the cost function
	global minimum. The effect of anthropometric parameter variations
	is also examined and these variations influence the results significantly.
	The optimal crank arm length, seat height, and longitudinal foot
	position on the pedal increase as the size of rider increases whereas
	the optimal cadence and seat tube angle decrease as the rider's size
	increases. The dependence of optimization results on anthropometric
	parameters emphasizes the importance of tailoring bicycle equipment
	to the anthropometry of the individual.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the muscle power contributions to the crank and
	limb segments in recumbent pedaling would be useful in the development
	of rehabilitative pedaling exercises. The objectives of this work
	were to 1) quantify the power contributions of the muscles to driving
	the crank and limb segments using a forward dynamic simulation of
	low-power pedaling in the recumbent position, and 2) determine whether
	there were differences in the muscle power contributions at three
	different pedaling rates. A forward dynamic model was used to determine
	the individual muscle excitation amplitude and timing to drive simulations
	that best replicated experimental kinematics and kinetics of recumbent
	pedaling. The segment kinematics, pedal reaction forces, and electromyograms
	(EMG) of 10 muscles of the right leg were recorded from 16 subjects
	as they pedaled a recumbent ergometer at 40, 50, and 60 rpm and a
	constant 50 W workrate. Intersegmental joint moments were computed
	using inverse dynamics and the muscle excitation onset and offset
	timing were determined from the EMG data. All quantities were averaged
	across ten cycles for each subject and averaged across subjects.
	The model-generated kinematic and kinetic quantities tracked almost
	always within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the experimental data
	for all three pedaling rates. The uniarticular hip and knee extensors
	generated 65% of the total mechanical work in recumbent pedaling.
	The triceps surae muscles transferred power from the limb segments
	to the crank and the bi-articular muscles that crossed the hip and
	knee delivered power to the crank during the leg transitions between
	flexion and extension. The functions of the individual muscles did
	not change with pedaling rate, but the mechanical energy generated
	by the knee extensors and hip flexors decreased as pedaling rate
	increased. By varying the pedaling rate, it is possible to manipulate
	the individual muscle power contributions to the crank and limb segments
	in recumbe- - nt pedaling and thereby design rehabilitative pedaling
	exercises to meet specific objectives.},

	is usually quite small leading to the natural question: Given a smooth

	that allows a simple motorcycle model to exactly track the plane
	trajectory? In this paper, we develop a technique for proving that
	such exact tracking is possible and apply it to a number of example
	cases. Our technique is based on the nonlinear system inversion work

	for action decomposition, turning higher level goals or missions
	into physical action at the human-machine interface. The internal
	model is an internal representation of the environment which the
	human is assumed to possess and is divided into four submodel categories.
	The sensory information processor is responsible for sensory composition.
	All three parts of the model act in consort to allow anticipatory
	behavior on the part of the human in goal-directed interaction with
	dynamic systems. Human workload and error are interpreted in this
	framework, and the familiar example of an automobile commute is used
	to illustrate the nature of the activity in the three model elements.
	Finally, with the qualitative model as a guide, verbal protocols
	from a manned simulation study of a helicopter instrument landing
	task are analyzed with particular emphasis on the effect of automation
	on human-machine performance.},

	It was shown that such models can be extended to the description

  abstract = {In the popular literature there is a certain fascination with the
	concept of zero [1]Â[3]. While today the inconspicuous 0 is taken
	for granted, the situation was different in the distant past. For
	example, the Romans had no symbol for 0, a fact memorialized by the
	jump from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D., a convention instituted in 531 A.D. [4,
	p. 91]. In contrast, the Mayans had a symbol for zero, and the first
	day of each Mayan month was day zero [3, p. 18]. The modern zero
	of mathematics slowly earned its membership in the club of numbers
	through Indian mathematics, although this acceptance was achieved
	only through a tortuous process that spanned centuries [3]. A conceptual
	impediment to the acceptance of zero is the difficulty in understanding
	the ratio 1/0. Presumably, this ratio is infinity or ?, a much more
	challenging concept. That 0 and inifinity are close cousins casts
	suspicion on zero as a valid number. Even in modern times, the zero
	appears begrudgingly on your telephone keypad after the 9. In Europe,
	the ground floor in a building is routinely labeled 0, and thus the
	meaning of floor -1 is unambiguous, whereas, in the United States,
	there is no floor 0, and negative floor numbers are rarely used.
	Despite the human reluctance to admit zero as an authentic number,
	it is as difficult to imagine mathematics today without zero as it
	is to imagine technology without the wheel and axle. Although the
	number zero is well known, the system-theoretic concept of a system
	zero is virtually unknown outside of dynamics and control theory.
	The purpose of this article is to illuminate the critical role of
	system zeros in control- system performance for the benefit of a
	wide audience both inside and outside the control systems community.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop an instrument for quantifying
	the motion of the hip relative to the bicycle while cycling in the
	standing position. Because of the need to measure hip motion on the
	road as well as in the laboratory, a goniometer which locates the
	hip using spherical coordinates was designed. The goniometer is presented
	first, followed by the development of the equations that enable the
	distance from the joint center to the pedal spindle to be determined.
	The orientation of this line segment is specified by calculating
	two angles referenced to the frame. Also outlined are the procedures
	used to both calibrate the goniometer and perform an accuracy check.
	The results of this check indicate that the attachment point of the
	goniometer to the rider can be located to within 2.5 mm of the true
	position. The goniometer was used to record the hip movement patterns
	of six subjects who cycled in the standing position on a treadmill.
	Representative results from one test subject who cycled at 6% grade
	and 25 km h-1 are presented. Results indicate that the bicycle is
	leaned from side to side with the frequency of leaning equal to the
	frequency of pedalling. Extreme lean angles are Â±6Â°. The distance
	from the hip to the pedal varies approximately sinusoidally with
	frequency equal to pedalling rate and amplitude somewhat less than
	crank arm length. The absolute elevation of the hip, however, exhibits
	two cycles for each crank cycle. Asymmetry in the plot of elevation
	over a single crank cycle indicates that the pelvis rocks from side
	to side and that the elevation of the pelvis midpoint changes. Extreme
	values of the pelvis rocking angle are Â±12Â°. Highest pelvis midpoint
	elevations, however, do not occur at the same crank angles as those
	angles at which the pelvis rocking is extreme. It appears that the
	vertical motion of the hips affects pedalling mechanics when cycling
	in the standing position.},

	a cost function derived from the joint moments developed during cycling

	relation between these variables and the cost function. A crank arm
	length of 170 mm and pedalling rate of 100 rpm correspond closely
	to the cost function minimum. In cycling situations where the rpm
	deviates from 100 rpm, however, crank arms of length other than 170
	mm yield minimum cost function values. In addition, the sensitivity
	of optimization results to both increased power and anthropometric
	parameter variations is examined. At increased power, the cost function
	minimum is more strongly related to the pedalling rate, with higher
	pedalling rates corresponding to the minimum. Anthropometric parameter
	variations influence the results significantly. In general it is
	found that the cost function minimum for tall people occurs at longer

	angles. Data were recorded for three male subjects of similar anthropometric
	characteristics. Subjects rode under different pedalling conditions
	to explore how both pedal forces and pedalling rates affect the biomechanics
	of the pedalling process. By modelling the leg-bicycle as a five
	bar linkage and driving the linkage with the measured force and kinematic
	data, the joint moment histories due to pedal forces only (i.e. no
	motion) and motion only (i.e. no pedal forces) were generated. Total
	moments were produced by superimposing the two moment histories.
	The separate moment histories, together with the pedal forces and
	EMG results, enable a detailed biomechanical analysis of bicycle
	pedalling. Inasmuch as the results are similar for all three subjects,
	the analysis for one subject is discussed fully. One unique insight
	gained via this new method is the functional role that individual
	leg muscles play in the pedalling process.},

  year = {1991},
  volume = {24},
  pages = {577 - 586},
  number = {7},
  abstract = {The contributions of this article are twofold. One is a procedure
	for determining the angular velocity profile in seated cycling that
	maintains the total mechanical energy of both legs constant. A five-bar
	linkage model (thigh, shank, foot, crank and frame) of seated (fixed
	hip) cycling served for the derivation of the equations to compute
	potential and kinetic energies of the leg segments over a complete
	crank cycle. With experimentally collected pedal angle data as input,
	these equations were used to compute the total combined mechanical
	energy (sum of potential and kinetic energies of the segments of
	both legs) for constant angular velocity pedalling at 90 rpm. Total
	energy varied indicating the presence of internal work. Motivated
	by a desire to test the hypothesis that reducing internal work in
	cycling will reduce energy expenditure, a procedure was developed
	for determining the angular velocity profile that eliminated any
	change in total energy. Using data recorded from five subjects, this
	procedure was used to determine a reference profile for an average
	equivalent cadence of 90 rpm. The pahse of this profile is such that
	highest and lowest angular velocities occur when the cranks are near
	vertical and horizontal respectively. The second contribution is
	the testing of the hypothesis that the reference angular velocity
	profile serves to effectively reduce internal work for the subjects
	whose data were used to develop this profile over the range of pedalling
	rates (80-100 rpm) naturally preferred. In this range, the internal
	work was decreased a minimum of 48% relative to the internal work
	associated with constant angular velocity pedalling. The acceptance
	of this hypothesis has relevance to the protocol for future experiments
	which explore the effect of reduced internal work on energy expenditure
	in cycling.},

	stabilize the bicycle in motion. In general, a pendulum is applied
	to adjust the CG of the bicycle. An additional factor is the inclination
	with respect to gravitational direction of the bicycle in motion
	(i.e., lean angle). As a whole, the system produces three outputs
	that will affect the dynamic balance of the electric bicycle: the
	angles of the pendulum, the lean, and the steering. The proposed
	control method used to generate the handle and pendulum torques is

	electrical bicycle. In order to do so, two strategies are employed
	in this paper. One is to control the bikepsilas center of gravity
	(CG), and the other is to control the angle of the bikepsilas steering
	handle. In addition, the proposed system produces three outputs that
	will affect the dynamic balance of an electrical bicycle: the bikepsilas
	pendulum angle, lean angle, and steering angle. Based on the data
	of input-output, two scaling factors are employed to normalize the
	sliding surface and its derivative. According to the concept of if-then
	rule, an appropriate rule table for the ith subsystem is obtained.
	Then the output scaling factor based on Lyapunov stability is determined.
	The proposed control method used to generate the handle torque and
	pendulum torque is called fuzzy sliding-mode under-actuated control
	(FSMUAC). The purpose of using the FSMUAC is the huge uncertainties
	of a bicycle system often caused by different ground conditions and
	gusts of wind; merely ordinary proportional-derivative-integral (PID)
	control method or other linear control methods usually do not show
	good robust performance in such situations.},

  review = {He says Aoki1979 did experiments, measured steer torque and did some
	basic system id.
	
	
	He uses the manually controlled input signal for system identification
	of the underlying vehicle model. He notes that special perturbations
	are not needed.
	
	
	He develops a motorcycle model using Lagrange's method and cites similartiy
	to Sharp's work. He does this symbolically with Maple. His model
	is 10th order.
	
	
	He measured some tire properties, but describes very little about
	it.
	
	
	He shows comparisons to several other numerical motorcycle models
	and then talk about model reduction. He can reduce the models to
	6 ro 7th order when it is stable and get similar response up to 12hz.
	
	
	He instrumented an off-road motorcycle to measure:
	
	- Forward speed with a magnetic pickup on the wheel
	
	- Steering torque by mounting a light weight extra handlebar set coaxilaly
	with the steer axis which was connected to the handlebars via a tangential
	load cell (probably similar to Cheng2003)
	
	- Yaw and roll rates with rate gyros
	
	- Lateral acceleration with mems accelerometers (didn't use do to
	noise from engine)
	
	- Steering angle with potentiometer.
	
	
	His experiments were primarily on asphalt but a few were done on a
	flat dirt track too. He basically just road the motorcycle and applied
	"random" perturbations to the extra handlebars for a steer torque
	input to the motorcycle. Speeds were from 2 m/s to 19 m/s.
	
	
	He shows the power spectral density of the steer torque signal for
	the asphaly runs which start to taper off around 10 hz or so. The
	weave frequency has ten times the amplitude as the wobble frequency.
	He says steering torque was correlated to yaw rate at a 0.1-0.2 second
	delay and points to the fact that the rider had to keep the motorcycl
	from running off of the single lane track. He says that since there
	is output to input feedback he couldn't use non-parametric models,
	models with output error and models fit with subspace methods. He
	cites Ljung's book for explanation. This is new to me.
	
	
	He uses black box ARX models for his fits for SIMO. He mentions that
	assesing goodness of fit with residuals was confounded by unsuitable
	time scaling and model instability at low speeds. There is something
	about the frequency of the data being high enough for the system
	id to pick up the both weave and wobble modes.
	
	
	Figure four shows identified weave mode poles for the experiments
	in comparison to the ones predicted by his motorcycle model. He show
	confidence intervals around the identified poles, but the model results
	doesn't seem to match the id results. He does claim that this figure
	shows the prediction of instability below 5 m/s. There are differences
	in the dirt experiment and the asphaly experiments. He tried various
	combinations of outputs in the id process, but found roll rate to
	be critical for identifying weave.
	
	
	Figure five shows some eigenvector phasor plots for the weave mode
	at three different speeds. The choice of visualization is pretty
	poor, but it looks like there is only decent agreement in the yaw
	phasor. He says they agree well but gives no numbers as to how well.
	
	
	Figure six shows the wobble eigenvalue comparions, which look pretty
	bad, but he says the it was robust?? I don't see how.
	
	
	He shows steer torque to yaw rate ratios as a function of speed for
	steady turns and compares it to other models. Yet the other models
	are not the same motorcycle parameters.
	
	
	Figure 8 shows Bode plots for various speeds and compares his experimental
	results with his model. The agreement doesn't look as bad in this
	view.
	
	
	He fit lower order models (6 and 7th) to the experimental data even
	though his first principles models were of higher order.
	
	
	He measured some of the physical properties of his motorcycle but
	it was very thorough, leaving some parameters as estimates.},

	while pedalling a bycycle on rollers in the laboratory. Each electromyogram
	(EMG) data channel was digitized at a sampling rate of 2 kHz by a
	minicomputer. Data analysis entailed generating plots of both EMG
	activity regions and integrated EMG (IEMG). For each test subject,
	data were recorded for five cases of pedalling conditions. The different
	pedalling conditions were defined to explore a variety of research
	hypotheses. This exploration has led to the following conclusions:
	1. (1) Muscular activity levels of the quadriceps are influenced
	by the type of shoes worn and activity levels increase with soft
	sole shoes as opposed to cycling shoes with cleats and toeclips.
	2. (2) EMG activity patterns are not strongly related to pedalling
	conditions (i.e. load, seat height and shoe type). The level of muscle
	activity, however, is significantly affected by pedalling conditions.
	3. (3) Muscular activity bears a complex relationship with seat height
	and quadriceps activity level decreases with greater seat height.
	4. (4) Agonist (i.e. hamstrings) and antagonist (i.e. quadriceps)
	muscles of the hip/knee are active simultaneously during leg extension.
	Regions of peak activity levels, however, do not overlap. The lack
	of significant cocontraction of agonist/antagonist muscles enables
	muscle forces during pedalling action to be computed by solving a
	series of equilibrium problems over different regions of the crank
	cycle. Regions are defined and a solution procedure is outlined.},

	the optimal height to the pedaling mechanics of the rider in both
	the seated and standing postures, (3) to determine the dependence
	of the optimal height on the rider posture. Eleven experienced subjects
	rode a custom-built adjustable dual suspension off-road bicycle,

	Adjustable Suspension Kinematics,{''} Journal of Mechanical Design
	/b 119/, pp. 370-375], on an inclined treadmill. The treadmill was
	set to a constant 6 percent grade at a constant velocity of 24.8
	km/hr. With the bicycle in a fixed gear combination of 38{*}14, the
	corresponding cadence was 84 rpm. For each subject, the pivot point
	height was varied randomly while the motions across both the front
	and rear suspension elements were measured. Subjects rode in both
	the seated and standing postures and with the front suspension active
	and inactive. It was found that the power loss from the rear suspension
	at the optimal pivot point height was not significantly dependent
	on the interaction between the front and rear suspensions. In the
	seated posture, the optimal pivot point height was 9.8 cm on average
	and had a range of 8.0-12.3 cm. The average optimal pivot point height
	for the seated posture corresponded to an average power loss for
	the rear suspension that was within 10 percent of the minimum power
	loss for each subject for 8 of the 11 subjects. In the standing posture,
	the average height was 5.9 cm and ranged from 5.1-7.2 cm. The average
	height for the standing posture was within 10 percent of the minimum
	power loss for each subject for 9 of the 11 subjects. While the optimum
	height was relatively insensitive to pedaling mechanics in both the

	height in production bicycles necessitates some compromise in performance

  abstract = { Fully enclosed motorcycles could form the basis for extremely fuel
	and space efficient vehicles, but their inherent instability upon
	encountering even a momentary loss of traction renders them unsuitable
	for general use. It will be shown that a relatively simple tilt control
	system using a gyroscope to provide a tilt control moment is capable
	of stabilizing the vehicle at still stand or at speed on a very low
	traction surface. Furthermore, the system can achieve a coordinated
	turn on high traction surfaces. Since the gyro is an energy storage

	has been used for maintaining the desired path of the scooter. The

	was posed as an optimal control problem. The cost functional produced
	a chainring shape that reduced the cost of endurance cycling at 250
	W and 90 rpm, apparently by taking advantage of mechanical interactions
	that arise as a natural consequence of the movement. However, the
	predicted joint moments required larger peak values during phases

	the Newton-Euler system of dynamic equations for the leg segments

	and the intersegmental moments. Applications of the technique to
	cycling studies of muscle function, pedalling effectiveness, and

	this article focuses on the pedal force in cycling, the decomposition
	method can be directly applied to analyze the reaction forces during
	a general planar movement of the leg when the segmental kinematics

	the significance of the nonmuscular component relative to the muscular
	component by performing the decomposition of the pedal forces of
	an example subject who pedalled at three different cadences against
	a common work load. The key results were that the nonmuscular components
	increased in magnitude as the cadence increased, whereas the magnitude
	of the muscular component remained relatively constant over the majority
	of the crank cycle. Also, even at the slowest pedalling rate of 70
	rpm, the magnitude of the nonmuscular component was substantial.},

	The simplified model of the bicycle with the balancer is derived

	with only balancer or steering. The trajectory tracking control is
	derived by an input-output linearization approach to track the path
	in the ground plane. The steering and the back wheel are used to
	design the trajectory control. The coupling of the steering between
	the balancing control and the trajectory control are set by weighting

  abstract = {Recently a model of the motion of an uncontrolled bicycle was benchmarked.
	In this model, many physical aspects of the real bicycle are considered
	negligible, such as the fexibility of the frame and wheels, play
	in the bearings, and precise tire characteristics. Apart from fexibility
	and play, in this model the most un- certain aspect, that had to
	be verifed was the replacement of the tires by ideal rolling, knife-edge
	wheels. The admissibility of these assumptions was checked by comparing
	experimental results with numerical simulation results. The experimental
	system consisted of an instrumented bicycle without rider. Sensors
	were installed on the bicycle for measuring the lean rate and the
	yaw rate, the steering angle and the rear wheel rotation. Sidewheels
	were added to the bicycle to prevent it from completely falling over
	under unstable conditions. All twenty five parameters of the instrumented
	bicycle required for the lin- earised model were measured. The lengths
	were measured with a tape measure, angles with an integrated protractor
	and spirit-level and the mass of the different parts with scales
	accurate to 0.01kg. For the measurement of the mass moment of inertia
	of the front frame, rear frame, front wheel and rear wheel a torsion
	pendulum was constructed. Measurements were recorded for the case
	in which the bicycle coasted freely on a level surface. From the
	measured data, eigenvalues for the bicycle were extracted by means
	of curve fitting. These eigenvalues were then compared with the results
	from the linearised equations of motion of the model. The experimental
	results show a very good agreement with the results as ob- tained
	by the linearised analysis of the dynamic model of an uncontrolled
	bicycle. This shows that the tire slip and frame and fork compliance
	are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the
	speed range up to 6 m/s.},

  abstract = {A riderless bicycle can automatically steer itself so as to recover
	from falls. The common view is that this self-steering is caused
	by gyroscopic precession of the front wheel, or by the wheel contact
	trailing like a caster behind the steer axis. We show that neither
	effect is necessary for self-stability. Using linearized stability
	calculations as a guide, we built a bicycle with extra counter-rotating
	wheels (canceling the wheel spin angular momentum) and with its front-wheel
	ground-contact forward of the steer axis (making the trailing distance
	negative). When laterally disturbed from rolling straight, this bicycle
	automatically recovers to upright travel. Our results show that various
	design variables, like the front mass location and the steer axis
	tilt, contribute to stability in complex interacting ways.},

	is because it damps out rapidly below the weave critical speed, thus
	not easy to measure and that above the weave critical speed that
	the capsize eigenvalue is so slow that it is hard to measure and
	the weave motion dominates. This is not quite right though as the
	eigen value magnitudes are the same at least one speed in within
	the stable speed range. Their final conclusion is that the eigenvalues
	and critical speeds are well predicted between a certain speed range
	and that treadmill riding is the same as riding on flat ground. This
	should be clarified with respect to riderless bicycles. The steer
	angle on the plot is rather steady, maybe because the scaling is

	of an uncontrolled bicycle is presented. In numerical models, many
	physical aspects of the real bicycle are considered negligible, such
	as the flexibility of the frame and wheels, play in the bearings,
	and precise tire characteristics. The admissibility of these assumptions
	has been checked by comparing experimental results with numerical
	simulation results. The numerical simulations were performed on a
	three-degree-of-freedom benchmarked bicycle model. For the validation
	we considered the linearized equations of motion for small perturbations
	of the upright steady forward motion. The most dubious assumption
	that was validated in this model was the replacement of the tires
	by knife-edge wheels rolling without slipping (non-holonomic constraints).
	The experimental system consisted of an instrumented bicycle without
	rider. Sensors were present for measuring the roll rate, yaw rate,
	steering angle, and rear wheel rotation. Measurements were recorded
	for the case in which the bicycle coasted freely on a level surface.
	From these measured data, eigenvalues were extracted by means of
	curve fitting. These eigenvalues were then compared with the results
	from the linearized equations of motion of the model. As a result,
	the model appeared to be fairly accurate for the low-speed low-frequency

	Ships are usually modeled by first principles with a 3rd order model
	called Nomoto's model. They find that even with poor data, Nomoto's
	parameters can be found, but with better data higher order models
	may be better. He exami nes the identifiability of Nomto's model
	and notes that some extra sensors (than normally on a ship) help
	make the parameters uniquely identifiable. They examined both open
	and closed loop dynamics (i.e. with and without autopilot). The open
	loop tests were done by commanding binary randomlike steering commands.
	During closed loop they let changed the desired heading a random
	binary fashion and also changed the autopilot gain. The found the
	predicition error methods to be generally better than the output
	error methods, but the prediction horizon was important. Nomoto's
	model is a simplified linear transfer function relating sway velocity
	to rudder angle. They use Norribin's nonlinear model, as it only
	introduces one more parameter to the linear model. He shows that
	you can try to estimate the continous parameters directly or you
	can write the continious parameters as a functino of the discrete
	parameters, thus estimating them first. He compares the estimated
	parameters from three experiments for a ship using both the discrete
	and continous model. They find similar parameters from both discrete
	and continous and mostly the same parameters across experiments.
	The output error method gave different results than the maximum likelehood.
	He says that a the Akaike criterion indicated that a third order
	model was better than a 2nd order model. He found differences in
	the discrete and continious methods with the sea scout data (continious
	did more poorly). He found that 60s prediction horizon was need for
	good estimates with the sea stratus data. He says that a complex
	pole zero pair indicated was probably due to wave disturbances at
	.2 hz and not actual process dynamics.
	
	
	Grey box: he sets up a very complicated state space parameterization
	including process and measurement noise covariance matrices. They
	use a Kalman filter for state estimation. He talks about the identifibility
	of the parametes and says that given sway velocity and heading measurements,
	plus know acceleration derivatives and that the model is observable
	and controlable then the parameters are identifiables (he cites previous
	work for this). He can't identify all parameters of R1 and R2. He
	fixes some parameters based on physical models. WIth the output error
	method, he gets a large variation in parameter estimates among experiments.
	For the prediction error method he finds that at least a 10s prediction
	horizon is needed for good results and parameter estimation. He shows
	the "best" model simulation plot for a different experiment input
	with good fit results. Summary: parameter estimation was good for
	predictio error methods given the horizon wasn't too short. The output
	error method usually gave poor results.},

	and steer, effectively giving gains on angle, rate, angular acceleration
	and the integral of angle. I'm not sure what the physical meaning
	of the integral of an angle would be. He uses the same nueromuscular
	model as us but with a frequency of 2.17 rad/s and a damping ratio
	of 1.414. He also includes a time delay of 0.03 ms. He mentions co-contraction
	control which is a passive stiffness and damping in the arm muscles
	that he claims is utilize in position tasks, but doesn't use it.
	He cites Happee2009. He rewrites his controller and plant into a
	general form, of which he say any plant and controller can be mapped
	to. Peter seemed to use data from runs with Luke riding, but must
	have used the parameters for me, as I hadn't calculated them yet,
	not sure though. He fit a Finite Impulse Response black box model
	to the roll and steer angles. He shows the resulting model output
	which is very noisy and then with a filtered version. When trying
	to fit a parametric model, he found that the time delay, however
	small, caused the system to be unstable. He also was unable to get
	a stable model for a low speed of 2.1 m/s, citing that the FIR model
	has a poor signal to noise ratio. He only fits on the steer angle
	output, but gets reasonable matching in roll as a side effect. He
	uses a method to examine covariance of the parameters to eliminate
	ones that are crucial for the model. He notes that the steer into
	the fall is observed from the estimated roll related gains being
	positive. He says roll angle, roll rate, steering rate and integral
	action are critical for a stable model. He shows that this integral
	steering is proportional to the heading angle. So he controls heading
	without having heading feedback. He also uses it to explain countersteering.

  abstract = {The method for the development of the equations of motion for systems

	It is shown that what Kane calls partial velocities and partial angular
	velocities may be interpreted as components of tangent vectors to
	the system's configuration manifold. The geometric picture, when
	attached to Kane's formalism shows that Kane's Equations are projections
	of the Newton-Euler equations of motion onto a spanning set of the
	configuration manifold's tangent space. One advantage of Kane's method,
	is that both non-holonomic and non-conservative systems are easily
	included in the same formalism. This easily follows from the geometry.
	It is also shown that by transformation to an orthogonal spanning
	set, the equations can be diagonalized in terms of what Kane calls
	the generalized speeds. A further advantage of the geometric picture
	lies in the treatment of constraint forces which can be expanded
	in terms of a spanning set for the orthogonal complement of the configuration
	tangent space. In all these developments, explicit use is made of
	a concrete realization of the multidimensional vectors which are
	called K-vectors for a K-component system. It is argued that the
	current presentation also provides a clear tutorial route to Kane's
	method for those schooled in classical analytical mechanics.},

  review = {JKM - Limebeer and Sharp show a graph of steer torque for the benchmark
	bicycle model on page 47 for step inputs of steer torque that range
	from -0.5 to 2.5 Nm for extreme roll and steer angles.
	
	
	They give a basic historical overview of bicycles and motorcycles.
	They then talk about the history of the bicycle/motorcycle equations
	with a callout about Whipple. They give a basic point mass model
	which is the same as the one in Astrom2005 and show the speed dependency
	of the steer to roll transfere function. They then show the Whipple
	model results with the benchmark parameters. He gives good description
	of the weave, capsize and caster modes in terms of the eigenvectors.
	
	
	He looks at some special cases of the Whipple model:
	
	
	- locked steering: bicycle capsizes at all speeds
	
	- point mass model with trail and head angle: take away inertia from
	whipple model: steer torque to steer angle transfer function is a
	constant, a virtual spring.
	
	- no trail, head angle or front frame mass offset: shows steer to
	roll relationship
	
	- no trail, no head angle: adds steering damping...
	
	- gyro effects: easily rideable in experiments, a simple low bandwith
	challenge for the rider, no auto stable range. he mentions Jim's
	no trail, no gyro model
	
	
	He points out counter steering early accounts of the phenomena. He
	then says you can think of countersteering in two ways. The first
	is always present and the second is only present at high speeds.
	The second describes the opposite torque that may be needed to maintain
	a steady turn at high speed (i.e. steer torque left to initiate a
	right turn, but then steer torque right to maintain the turn). The
	first way is the more common interpretation. It is the fact that
	an intial left steer torque and steer angle to the left are require
	to go into a right turn.
	
	
	They emulate rider control of the Whipple model with roll rate plus
	roll angle feedback (PD on roll angle). He sets the two gains to
	zero in the autostable region and sets them to stablizing values
	outside. He chooses gains for three speeds such that the torque step
	response gives about the same steady state roll angle.
	
	
	Steer torque left to initiate right turn and then steer torque right
	to stabilize happens a high speed (above stable speed range). Fig
	16
	
	
	He points out the steer angle and lateral displacement show initial
	overshoot (i.e. non mimium phase behavior) and attributes it to the
	zero in the steer torque to steer angle transfer function.
	
	
	He claims that closing the roll loop with PD and picking stablizing
	gains forces the steer torque input to osciallate at th weave frequency.
	This implies that control is done at the weave frequency.
	
	
	Alot more to detail...
	
	
	Should go through all the refereneces...
	
	
	Body lean control is helpful when near a curb.
	
	
	It is interesting to note that both here and in Astrom 2005 the countersteer

  abstract = {To provide data for fatigue life prediction and testing of structural
	components in off-road bicycles, the objective of the research described
	herein was to quantify the loads input to an off-road bicycle as
	a result of surface-induced loads. A fully instrumented test bicycle
	was equipped with dynamometers at the pedals, handlebars, and hubs
	to measure all in-plane structural loads acting through points of
	contact between the bicycle and both the rider and the ground. A
	portable data acquisition system carried by the standing rider allowed,
	for the first time, this loading information to be collected during
	extended off-road testing. In all, 7 experienced riders rode a downhill
	trail test section with the test bicycle in both front-suspension
	and full-suspension configurations. The load histories were used
	quantitatively to describe the bad components through the computation
	of means, standard deviations amplitude probability density functions,
	and power spectral density functions. For the standing position,
	the coefficients of variation for the load components normal to the
	ground were greater than 1.2 for handlebar forces and 0.3 and 0.5-0.6
	for the pedal and hub forces, respectively. Thus the relative contribution
	of the dynamic loading was much greater than the static loading at
	the handlebars but less so at the pedals and hubs. As indicated by
	the rainflow count, high amplitude loading was developed approaching
	3 and 5 times the weight of the test subjects at the front and rear
	wheels, respectively. The power spectral densities showed that energy
	was concentrated in the band 0-50 Hz. Through stress computations
	and knowledge of material properties, the data can be used analytically
	to predict the fatigue life of important structural components such
	as those for steering. The data can also be used to develop a fatigue
	testing protocol for verifying analytical predictions of fatigue
	life.},

  review = {JKM-They use a bicycle simulator that mimics a very basic bicycle
	model to estimate the open loop transfer function of the human operator
	in a simple bicycle stabilization task. They used a PID controller
	with a time lag to represent the human and used an optimization technique
	that minimized the error between the experimental ouputs of the human
	and the model outputs from the PID controller using the same experimental
	input. They found some variance between riders and runs but claimed
	it was because they were controlling the bicycle at 15 km/h and thus
	it wasn't a critical control task.
	
	
	- they say the bicycle is an unstable system because they used a very
	simple model
	
	- they assume the rider uses steer angle and rider lean angle to control
	the roll angle of the bicycle
	
	- there is more detail to the project in their annual report from
	the same year (Lunteren1970)
	
	- they only mention Whipple as a previous model
	
	- the simulator neglects the frame and fork coupling, among other
	things
	
	- they don't test speeds below 10 km/h
	
	- they use the simplest bicycle model (same as presented by Karnopp
	and others) with a upper body that can lean
	
	- they got inertia, CoM, and mass values for the human from Williams
	and Lissner 1962
	
	- the simulator is assumed to have resonable similiarity to a bicycle
	and a rider only takes a few minutes to learn to stabilize it
	
	- I am not sure how they measured lean angle of the rider
	
	- they assume a PID controller with a time lag for the human operator
	control model
	
	- they do include remnant in the system model
	
	- they estimate the PID coefficients and time lag by minimizing the
	error between the measure outputs from the simulator experiments
	to the output of the PID model. this simply looks at the open loop
	linear model of the human operator
	
	- their minimization techniques seemed to be a bit limited then. they
	didn't try to work with closed loop model and had to make more assumptions
	for when minimizing with respect to the time lag. we could do this
	much easier with todays tools
	
	- there is probably an optimal observation time for the experiments
	that minimize uncertaintity, this may not be trivial
	
	- the remnant produces a bias if this optimization technique is used
	for the closed loop system
	
	- they only had 4k of memory on their computer, but still did most
	of the calcs real time for the transfer function parameters
	
	- Figure 5 compares this optimization technique to some others they've
	done, one of which doesn't have the bias
	
	- they then look at the variance of riders control actions over time
	and over a group of riders
	
	- fig 6 shows that a rider's behavior can be treated as invariant
	for up to 5 minutes
	
	- comparing two riders, they show that the handlebar actions are similar
	but the upper body actions are not so similar
	
	- the nyquist plot of the two riders shows that there is a considerable
	difference in control actions but they both easily stablize the system,
	they do note that the riders were of different sizes
	
	- they think that making the stabilization task more difficult would
	make the riders behave more similar
	
	- they feel their procedure to determine the time delay numbers is
	good even though they had to make extra assumptions
	
	- they found a proportional relationship between the standard deviations
	of the transfer functions when taking more tests and using more subjects
	
	- they wonder whether the remnant should represent non-linearaties
	or a test signal introduced by the rider
	
	- they found a 0.5hz frequency when no external disturbances were
	applied},

  review = {The bicycle can be used for normal folks instead of highly trained
	pilots as most studies have previously been focused on. The bicycle
	is also unstable requiring the rider to stablize it. Figrue one shows
	a McRuer like human control system.
	
	
	The goals of this study are to answer:
	
	1. How accurately can the human be described by a linear model plus
	remnant?
	
	2. How variable is the model for a given subject?
	
	3. How valid is the model for a randomly chosen group of riders?
	
	
	They oversimplified Whipple's model for their bicycle simulator only
	using the roll dynamics. The simulator coudl be pedaled or the pedaling
	torque created by a motor for motorcycle/moped simulations. A noise
	component coudl be injected in to the simulator's dynamics for side
	wind simulatiosn and such. They can only do online parameter estimation
	with the PID model even though they know about McRuer's poles/zeros
	forumation.
	
	
	They estimate the rider parameters with a basic linear regression
	on the current time steps based on a moving average. This seems to
	be flawed to some degree because the parameter estimations will be
	poor with few time samples and get better as more sample are collected.
	A moving average only uses a finite previous times too. They mention
	that this method is only valid for open loop systems because a bias
	due to remnant would be introduced otherwise. The parameters can
	be identified to 10% accuracy even when the relative remnant N1 is
	40%. The behavior of the rider was shown to be stationary for at
	least 5 min observation times. 5 male subjects tested every day over
	ten days, the results in the tables seem repeatable.
	
	
	Conclusions
	
	
	1. The best fit model is a PD with time delay.
	
	2. The time delays, lead time constants and effective values of remnant
	are very different for the two control actions.
	
	3. The lean action is lower in the cerebral heriarchy than the handlebar
	action.
	
	4. The variation in estimated parameters among all riders was about
	twice that of a single rider, thus a generalization of the model
	to a group may be poor.},

	most people can ride bikes. Interested primarily in the stabilization
	task. The studies started in 1962. They assume decoupled steer to
	frame motions...which seems bad. They allow the rider to lean. The
	model for the bicyle simulator is a simple doubple inverted pendulum,
	with roll moment acting on the frame due to steer angle and rate
	(plus the one due to bicycle roll and rider lean). They used a PID
	model instead of the McRuer models because of technical limitations
	of the equipment. The bicycle roll angle is fed back to give an error
	signal. This is then run through PID control with a time delay to
	give a steer angle and rider lean angle input to the bicycle. Remnant
	are introduced at the output of the controller blocks for each bicycle
	input. They find a 2 hz natural frequency of the human-bicycle system.
	
	
	
	He plots the auto and cross correlations of the steer angle, lean
	angle, roll angle and output noise. The output noise seems to be
	basically white. The angles have a peak frequency as 2 hz (and one
	at the pedaling frequency).
	
	
	They present a correlation method and on-line parameter estimation
	method to determine the transfer functions of the human, both giving
	similar results in the Bode plots of an example identification. The
	on-line method is 10 times faster though. 
	
	
	They say that the integral action didn't show up in either of the
	identified transfer functions. The ratio of derivative action to
	the proportional action of the upper body lean is three times that
	of the same ratio in the handlebar transfer functions. (i.e. lean
	angle is actuated more from roll rate than the handlebars are).
	
	
	They consider the steering action to be the result of cerebral activity
	and the upper body motion to be a reflex pattern based on a comparison
	of the identified time delays. The lean time delay is larger than
	the steer time delay. They used parameters for a moped in the simulator
	at 15 km/h. They show that the time delay increases as the give the
	rider drugs.

	the steer torque to the system. So the rider would specify the desired

	cumulative damage when the handlebar is subjected to loads applied
	by the rider's hands that vary randomly in both magnitude and direction,
	2) use this method with an existing database of handlebar loads (DeLorenzo
	and Hull, J Biomech Eng, 1999) to determine a single loading direction
	to be used in design and testing of the handlebar, and 3) determine
	the sensitivity of the point of maximum cumulative damage to structural
	and material properties of the handlebar. The load database was generated
	by seven subjects who rode a rough downhill course in the standing
	posture and provided a total of 28 trials for analysis. For each
	of the 28 trials, the stress histories at 1-degree increments around
	the handlebar circumference were determined. The cumulative damage
	at each of the 360 points for each of the 28 trials was computed
	using rainflow counting in conjunction with Walker's equation to
	represent the S-N diagram for the handlebar material. The maximum
	cumulative damage varied by more than six orders of magnitude between
	trials and the location of the point of maximum damage ranged from
	110Â° to 343Â° (angle measured from horizontal axis pointing forward
	with positive counterclockwise rotation viewed from the right side
	of the bicycle). The median location was 142Â°. To create a tensile
	stress in bending at 142Â°, a load would have to be applied at 322Â°
	(322Â° = 142Â°+180Â°). Thus, 322Â° was found to be the single loading
	direction representative of the variable-direction load database.
	This direction did not change for a handlebar with different structural
	and material properties and coincided approximately with a vector
	drawn along the line of the arms of the rider. This loading direction
	can be used in conjunction with information on the effects of assembly
	of the handlebar with a stem to analytically predict the high cycle
	fatigue life of a particular stem/handlebar assembly. Furthermore,
	this loading direction can also be used to experimentally determine
	the expected in-service fatigue life of a particular stem/handlebar
	assembly.},

  abstract = {The analytical basis of manual vehicular control theory is a combination
	of feedback systems analysis and mathematical models for human operators
	engaged in control tasks. Simplified representations for the operator-system
	combination are provided by the 'crossover model', which is described
	in detail. The system dynamics and average performance of the crossover
	model system are developed. With these as bases, case studies are
	presented to illustrate the types of result which can be obtained
	from application of the operator-vehicle control theory. Two aircraft
	control examples illustrate the use of the theory and its empirical
	correlates to estimate operator dynamic characteristics, system performance,
	pilot ratings, pilot commentary, design implications, and some experimental
	guidelines. A driver automobile example is presented to illustrate
	the use of the theory in structuring the key guidance and control
	features of the driver's visual field. A comprehensive bibliography
	of operator-vehicle system analysis applications is also provided.},

	wobble instabilities are found at much lower speeds, while the maximal

	bicycle model consisting of four rigid laterally symmetric ideally
	hinged parts: two wheels, a frame and a front assembly. The wheels
	are also axisymmetric and make ideal knife-edge rolling point contact
	with the ground level. The mass distribution and geometry are otherwise
	arbitrary. This conservative non-holonomic system has a seven-dimensional
	accessible configuration space and three velocity degrees of freedom
	parametrized by rates of frame lean, steer angle and rear wheel rotation.
	We construct the terms in the governing equations methodically for
	easy implementation. The equations are suitable for e.g. the study
	of bicycle self-stability. We derived these equations by hand in
	two ways and also checked them against two nonlinear dynamics simulations.
	In the century-old literature, several sets of equations fully agree
	with those here and several do not. Two benchmarks provide test cases
	for checking alternative formulations of the equations of motion
	or alternative numerical solutions. Further, the results here can
	also serve as a check for general purpose dynamic programs. For the
	benchmark bicycles, we accurately calculate the eigenvalues (the
	roots of the characteristic equation) and the speeds at which bicycle
	lean and steer are self-stable, confirming the century-old result
	that this conservative system can have asymptotic stability.},

  review = {DLP -- A model of a bicycle which includes rider lean angle and steer
	angle as control inputs is presented, analyzed, and its dynamic response
	is compared with that of an experimental bicycle. The model presents
	linearized EOMS and assumes no slip rolling, ignores mass of front
	fork and wheels, and assumes the center of mass of the rider and
	bicycle are lumped on a vertical line including the system center
	of mass. The model is a 2nd order. The EOMS are put into state space
	form, with the inputs being the steer angle and the rider lean angle,
	and outputs being the roll angle and the later deviation (not sure
	of exactly what point). It is found that the system is observable
	as long as the velocity is non zero, and that the systems is controllable
	as long as the speed is not equal to Lr*w and that the (4,2) entry
	of the B matrix is non-zero. \\
	
	
	Output feedback (roll angle and lateral deviation) is assumed, and
	the stability of the system is analyzed. The author considers three
	cases: Case A, when the feedback gain matrix (U=-K*Y) is diagonal,
	Case B, when only handlebar steering is used and rider lean is constant
	(second row of K is all zeroes), and Case C, when no restrictions
	are made on the gain matrix. For Case A and Case B, the author presents
	simple inequalities which much be satisfied to achieve stability,
	and interestingly, for Case A, he finds that to turn left, the rider
	must lean left and steer left -- the countersteer phenomenom is supposedly
	no longer present, an indication that RHP zeroes are moved into the
	LHP with additional control inputs. For Case B, he does find the
	countersteer phenomenom.},

  abstract = {One objective of this study was to investigate whether neuromuscular
	quantities were associated with preferred pedaling rate selection
	during submaximal steady-state cycling from a theoretical perspective
	using a musculoskeletal model with an optimal control analysis. Specific
	neuromuscular quantities of interest were the individual muscle activation,
	force, stress and endurance. To achieve this objective, a forward
	dynamic model of cycling and optimization framework were used to
	simulate pedaling at three different rates of 75, 90 and 105Â rpm
	at 265Â W. The pedaling simulations were produced by optimizing the
	individual muscle excitation timing and magnitude to reproduce experimentally
	collected data. The results from these pedaling simulations indicated
	that all neuromuscular quantities were minimized at 90Â rpm when
	summed across muscles. In the context of endurance cycling, these
	results suggest that minimizing neuromuscular fatigue is an important
	mechanism in pedaling rate selection. A second objective was to determine
	whether any of these quantities could be used to predict the preferred
	pedaling rate. By using the quantities with the strongest quadratic
	trends as the performance criterion to be minimized in an optimal
	control analysis, these quantities were analyzed to assess whether
	they could be further minimized at 90Â rpm and produce normal pedaling
	mechanics. The results showed that both the integrated muscle activation
	and average endurance summed across all muscles could be further
	minimized at 90Â rpm indicating that these quantities cannot be used
	individually to predict preferred pedaling rates.},

  abstract = {The goal of this research was to examine the accuracy of three methods
	used to indicate the hip joint center (HJC) in seated steady-state
	cycling. Two of the methods have been used in previous studies of
	cycling biomechanics and included tracking a marker placed over the
	superior aspect of the greater trochanter, a location that estimates
	the center of rotation of the hip joint, and assuming that the hip
	is fixed. The third method was new and utilized an anthropometric
	relationship to determine the hip joint location from a marker placed
	over the anterior-superior iliac spine. To perform a comparative
	analysis of errors inherent in the three methods, a standard method
	which located the true hip joint center was developed. The standard
	method involved establishing a pelvis-fixed coordinate system using
	a triad of video markers attached to an intracortical pin. Three-dimensional
	motion analysis quantified the true hip joint center position coordinates.
	To provide data for the comparative analysis, the intracortical pin
	was anchored to a single subject who pedaled at nine cadence-workrate
	combinations while data for all four methods were simultaneously
	recorded. At all cadence-workrate combinations the new method was
	more accurate than the trochanter method with movement errors lower
	by a factor of 2 in the vertical direction and a factor of 3 in the
	horizontal direction. Relative to the errors introduced by the fixed
	hip assumption, the new method was also generally more accurate by
	at least a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction and had comparable
	accuracy in the vertical direction. For computed kinetic quantities,
	the new method most accurately indicated hip joint force power but
	the fixed hip method most accurately indicated the work produced
	by the hip joint force over the crank cycle.},

  abstract = {To further understand lower extremity neuromuscular coordination in

	changes. These objectives were achieved by collecting electromyography
	(EMG) data of eight lower extremity muscles and crank angle data
	from ten subjects at 250 W across pedaling rates ranging from 45
	to 120 RPM. To examine the effect of pedaling rate on coordination,
	EMG burst onset and offset and integrated EMG (iEMG) were computed.
	In addition, a phase-controlled functional group (PCFG) analysis
	was performed to interpret observed changes in the EMG patterns in
	the context of muscle function. Results showed that the EMG onset
	and offset systematically advanced as pedaling rate increased except
	for the soleus which shifted later in the crank cycle. The iEMG results
	revealed that muscles responded differently to increased pedaling
	rate. The gastrocnemius, hamstring muscles and vastus medialis systematically
	increased muscle activity as pedaling rate increased. The gluteus
	maximus and soleus had significant quadratic trends with minimum
	values at 90 RPM, while the tibialis anterior and rectus femoris
	showed no significant association with pedaling rate. The PCFG analysis
	showed that the primary function of each lower extremity muscle remained
	the same at all pedaling rates. The PCFG analysis, which accounts
	for muscle activation dynamics, revealed that the earlier onset of
	muscle excitation produced muscle activity in the same region of
	the crank cycle. Also, while most of the muscles were excited for
	a single functional phase, the soleus and rectus femoris were excited
	during two functional phases. The soleus was classified as an extensor-bottom
	transition muscle, while the rectus femoris was classified as a top
	transition-extensor muscle. Further, the relative emphasis of each
	function appeared to shift as pedaling rate was increased, although
	each muscle remained bifunctional.},

	(ISLs) have been widely used to measure joint motion, it would be
	useful to extend the functionality of an ISL to measure joint motion
	in a dynamic environment. The objectives of the work reported by
	this paper were to (i) design and construct an ISL that will measure
	dynamic joint motion in a field environment, (ii) calibrate the ISL
	and quantify its static measurement error, (iii) quantify dynamic
	measurement error due to external acceleration, and (iv) measure
	ankle joint complex rotation during snowboarding maneuvers performed
	on a snow slope. An ï¿œelbow-typeï¿œ ISL was designed to measure
	ankle joint complex rotation throughout its range (ï¿œ30 deg for
	flexion/extension, ï¿œ15 deg for internal/external rotation, and
	ï¿œ15 deg for inversion/eversion). The ISL was calibrated with a
	custom six degree-of-freedom calibration device generally useful
	for calibrating ISLs, and static measurement errors of the ISL also
	were evaluated. Root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) were 0.59 deg for
	orientation (1.7% full scale) and 1.00 mm for position (1.7% full
	scale). A custom dynamic fixture allowed external accelerations (5
	g, 0ï¿œ50 Hz) to be applied to the ISL in each of three linear directions.
	Maximum measurement deviations due to external acceleration were
	0.05 deg in orientation and 0.10 mm in position, which were negligible
	in comparison to the static errors. The full functionality of the
	ISL for measuring joint motion in a field environment was demonstrated
	by measuring rotations of the ankle joint complex during snowboarding

  abstract = {Insights are provided by simple closed-loop models of human postural
	control. In developing a quantitative model to help us understand
	the postural control system, one might be tempted to capture as much
	of the complexity as is known about each of the subsystems. However,
	this article will follow the approach of Occam's Razor. That is,
	we begin with the simplest possible representation of each of the
	subsystems and only add complexity as necessary to be consistent
	with experimental data. For example, a control model with PD control
	and a positive force feedback loop provides a better explanation
	of the low-frequency dynamic behavior than the PID control model.
	Since both models have the same number of parameters, Occam's Razor
	favors the positive force feedback model over the PID model or any
	variation on the PID model that includes additional parameters. While
	there is some experimental evidence that positive force feedback
	plays a role in some aspects of motor control its contribution to
	postural control is unknown. Our model that includes positive force
	feedback represents a quantitative hypothesis that motivates additional
	experiments to confirm, or refute the contribution of positive force
	feedback to human postural control and to investigate the dynamic
	properties of this feedback loop. An important feature clearly revealed
	by the model-based interpretation of experimental data is the ability
	of the human postural control system to alter its source of sensory
	orientation cues as environmental conditions change. Our relatively
	simple models allowed us to apply systems identification methods
	in order to estimate the relative contributions (sensory weights)
	of various sensory orientation cues in different environmental conditions
	However, our simple models do not predict how the sensory weights
	should change as a function of environmental conditions or provide
	insight into the neural mechanisms that cause these changes.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that human bipedal upright stance is achieved
	by feedback mechanisms that generate an appropriate corrective torque
	based on body-sway motion detected primarily by visual, vestibular,
	and proprioceptive sensory systems. Because orientation information
	from the various senses is not always available (eyes closed) or
	accurate (compliant support surface), the postural control system
	must somehow adjust to maintain stance in a wide variety of environmental
	conditions. This is the sensorimotor integration problem that we
	investigated by evoking anterior-posterior (AP) body sway using pseudorandom
	rotation of the visual surround and/or support surface (amplitudes
	0.5–8°) in both normal subjects and subjects with severe bilateral
	vestibular loss (VL). AP rotation of body center-of-mass (COM) was
	measured in response to six conditions offering different combinations
	of available sensory information. Stimulus-response data were analyzed
	using spectral analysis to compute transfer functions and coherence
	functions over a frequency range from 0.017 to 2.23 Hz. Stimulus-response
	data were quite linear for any given condition and amplitude. However,
	overall behavior in normal subjects was nonlinear because gain decreased
	and phase functions sometimes changed with increasing stimulus amplitude.
	“Sensory channel reweighting” could account for this nonlinear behavior
	with subjects showing increasing reliance on vestibular cues as stimulus
	amplitudes increased. VL subjects could not perform this reweighting,
	and their stimulus-response behavior remained quite linear. Transfer
	function curve fits based on a simple feedback control model provided
	estimates of postural stiffness, damping, and feedback time delay.
	There were only small changes in these parameters with increasing
	visual stimulus amplitude. However, stiffness increased as much as
	60% with increasing support surface amplitude. To maintain postural
	stability and avoid resonant behavior, an increase in stiffness should
	be accompanied by a corresponding increase in damping. Increased
	damping was achieved primarily by decreasing the apparent time delay
	of feedback control rather than by changing the damping coefficient
	(i.e., corrective torque related to body-sway velocity). In normal
	subjects, stiffness and damping were highly correlated with body
	mass and moment of inertia, with stiffness always about 1/3 larger
	than necessary to resist the destabilizing torque due to gravity.
	The stiffness parameter in some VL subjects was larger compared with
	normal subjects, suggesting that they may use increased stiffness
	to help compensate for their loss. Overall results show that the
	simple act of standing quietly depends on a remarkably complex sensorimotor
	control system.},

	308–318] introduced a new method known as stabilogram diffusion analysis
	that provides a quantitative statistical measure of the apparently
	random variations of center-of-pressure (COP) trajectories recorded
	during quiet upright stance in humans. This analysis generates a
	stabilogram diffusion function (SDF) that summarizes the mean square
	COP displacement as a function of the time interval between COP comparisons.
	SDFs have a characteristic two-part form that suggests the presence
	of two different control regimes: a short-term open-loop control
	behavior and a longer-term closed-loop behavior. This paper demonstrates
	that a very simple closed-loop control model of upright stance can
	generate realistic SDFs. The model consists of an inverted pendulum
	body with torque applied at the ankle joint. This torque includes
	a random disturbance torque and a control torque. The control torque
	is a function of the deviation (error signal) between the desired
	upright body position and the actual body position, and is generated
	in proportion to the error signal, the derivative of the error signal,
	and the integral of the error signal [i.e. a proportional, integral
	and derivative (PID) neural controller]. The control torque is applied
	with a time delay representing conduction, processing, and muscle
	activation delays. Variations in the PID parameters and the time
	delay generate variations in SDFs that mimic real experimental SDFs.
	This model analysis allows one to interpret experimentally observed
	changes in SDFs in terms of variations in neural controller and time
	delay parameters rather than in terms of open-loop versus closed-loop
	behavior.},

  abstract = { Upright stance in humans is inherently unstable, requiring corrective
	action based on spatial-orientation information from sensory systems.
	One might logically predict that environments providing access to
	accurate orientation information from multiple sensory systems would
	facilitate postural stability. However, we show that, after a period
	in which access to accurate sensory information was reduced, the
	restoration of accurate information disrupted postural stability.
	In eyes-closed trials, proprioceptive information was altered by
	rotating the support surface in proportion to body sway (support
	surface "sway-referencing"). When the support surface returned to
	a level orientation, most subjects developed a transient 1-Hz body
	sway oscillation that differed significantly from the low-amplitude
	body sway typically observed during quiet stance. Additional experiments
	showed further enhancement of the 1-Hz oscillation when the surface
	transitioned from a sway-referenced to a reverse sway-referenced
	motion. Oscillatory behavior declined with repetition of trials,
	suggesting a learning effect. A simple negative feedback-control
	model of the postural control system predicted the occurrence of
	this 1-Hz oscillation in conditions where too much corrective torque
	is generated in proportion to body sway. Model simulations were used
	to distinguish between two alternative explanations for the excessive
	corrective torque generation. Simulation results favor an explanation
	based on the dynamic reweighting of sensory contributions to postural
	control rather than a load-compensation mechanism that scales torque
	in proportion to a fixed combination of sensory-orientation information.

  abstract = {A mathematical driver model is introduced in order to explain the
	driver steering behavior observed during successive double lane-change
	maneuvers. The model consists of a linear quadratic regulator path-following
	controller coupled to a neuromuscular system (NMS). The NMS generates
	the steering wheel angle demanded by the path-following controller.
	The model demonstrates that reflex action and muscle cocontraction
	improve the steer angle control and thus increase the path-following
	accuracy. Muscle cocontraction does not have the destabilizing effect
	of reflex action, but there is an energy cost. A cost function is
	used to calculate optimum values of cocontraction that are similar
	to those observed in the experiments. The observed reduction in cocontraction
	with experience of the vehicle is explained by the driver learning
	to predict the steering torque feedback. The observed robustness
	of the path-following control to unexpected changes in steering torque
	feedback arises from the reflex action and cocontraction stiffness
	of the NMS. The findings contribute to the understanding of driver-vehicle
	dynamic interaction. Further work is planned to improve the model;
	the aim is to enable the optimum design of steering feedback early
	in the vehicle development process.},

	is an (unstable) eigenmode with oscillations of the wheel about the

	is perceived unpleasant or may be dangerous, if not controlled by
	the rider in time. Basic research on wobble at motorcycles within
	the last decades has revealed a better understanding of the sudden
	onset of wobble, and the complex relations between parameters affecting
	wobble have been identified. These fundamental findings have been
	transferred to bicycles. As mass distribution and inertial properties,
	rider influence and lateral compliances of tyre and frame differ
	at bicycle and motorcycle, models to represent wobble at motorcycles
	have to prove themselves, when applied to bicycles. For that purpose
	numerical results are compared with measurements from test runs,
	and parametric influences on the stability of the wobble mode at
	bicycles have been evolved. All numerical analysis and measurements
	are based on a specific test bicycle equipped with steering angle
	sensor, wheel-speed sensor, global positioning system (GPS) 3-axis
	accelerometer, and 3-axis angular velocity gyroscopic sensor. },

  abstract = {Because musculoskeletal injuries to racehorses are common, instrumentation
	for the study of factors (e.g. track surface), which affect the ground
	reaction loads in horses during racing conditions, would be useful.
	The objectives of the work reported by this paper were to (1) design
	and construct a novel dynamometric horseshoe that is capable of measuring
	the complete ground reaction loading during racing conditions, (2)
	characterize static and dynamic measurement errors, and (3) demonstrate
	the usefulness of the instrument by collecting example data during
	the walk, trot, canter, and gallop for a single subject. Using electrical
	resistance strain gages, a dynamometric horseshoe was designed and
	constructed to measure the complete ground reaction force and moment
	vectors and the center of pressure. To mimic the load transfer surface
	of the hoof, the shape of the surface contacting the ground was similar
	to that of the solar surface of the hoof. Following static calibration,
	the measurement accuracy was determined. The root mean squared errors
	(RMSE) were 3% of full scale for the force component normal to the
	hoof and 9% for force components in the plane of the hoof. The dynamic
	calibration determined that the natural frequency with the full weight
	of a typical horse was 1744Â Hz. Example data were collected during
	walking on a ground surface and during trotting, cantering, and galloping
	on a treadmill. The instrument successfully measured the complete
	ground reaction load during all four gaits. Consequently the dynamometric
	horseshoe is useful for studying factors, which affect ground reaction
	loads during racing conditions.},

	The control model has inner loop roll stablization which consists
	of gains acting on the roll angle error, roll rate and roll acceleration
	(PID on roll rate) with a time delay and an extra pole (not sure
	of the effect it is like half a lead or lag). This gives six gains,
	2 time delays and two poles as the parameters for the roll stablization
	control. They have a simple gain on the path error to give a commanded
	roll angle (they sum back in the roll angle for some reason...).
	They also have some preview built in. They calculate the error in
	desired path to actual path out to several future time intervals
	and weight the results to with less weighting on further future errors.
	This sum of weighted errors is multiplied by a gain to compute the
	correction to the commanded roll angle.

	This report was carried out for the Schwinn Bicycle Company. This
	builds on the bicycle model by Roland and Massing 1971 and can be
	seen as the continuation of the work that was carried out in that
	report (also for Schwinn).
	
	
	The main objective of these reports is to study the effect of design
	parameters on bicycle stability and control. 
	
	This report has 4 distinct parts:
	
	
	chapter 2 : a rider control model for stabilising and tracking. 
	
	chapter 3 : bicycle tire testing
	
	chapter 4 : experimental testing of various bicycle configurations.
	
	chapter 5 : computer graphic animation of a bicycle simulation.
	
	
	Rider control model:
	
	The rider lean torque and steer torque are outputs and they control
	the lean angle with a delayed PID controler on the lean angle for
	both torques. The delayed PID controler is a simplification of a
	delayed lead-lag controler from literature:
	
	Elkind, J.I. 1956 "Characteristics of simple manual control systems"
	MIT, Lincoln laboratory Techinical Report No. 111. They are aware
	of the work of Stassen and van lunteren and clearly identify the
	difference in control strategy : steer agle versus steer torque.
	
	
	
	The tracking control is calculates from the states and the desired
	path a command rol angle. They tune the coeficients of the stabilising
	controler by looking at systems response driving straight ahead or
	applying a 20 degree comand roll angle like driving straight and
	getting into a curve. Even for the best controler we see an offset
	between the desired and obtained lean angle. The tracking controler
	makes a prediction of the path based on the state and compares this
	with the desired path and generates in adition to the desired lean
	angle a lean angle.
	
	To our knowledge this controller is never used. 
	
	
	Bicycle Tire testing:
	
	11 types of tires are tested. results are shown in graphs and shown
	in tables in the appendix. The general idea is that bicycle tires
	should have a camber thrust factor of about 1 or in other words:
	the tire force should always be aproximately in the plane of the
	wheel. The presented results are suspicious on this. 
	
	
	Experimental testing of Bicycle:
	
	They use the instrumented bicycle of Rolland \& Massing 1971. They
	have 9 configurations by playing around with load on rear, rider
	and front, increasing the mass moment of inertia of the front wheel
	and underinflating the tires. 
	
	the tests carried out are: 
	
	lows peed stability: riding in a 3 feet wide lane at minimum speed
	
	obstical avoidance: at the end of the 3 feet lane a dustbin is placed
	(4 feet from the end), at maximum speed
	
	narrow slalom: inline 10 feet apart, maximum speed.
	
	wide slalom: 2 feet lateral separation, 10 feet apart, maximum speed.
	
	
	
	They conclude that the standard bicycle the best! the other general
	conclusions are that load in the rear basket (not on rear rack) is
	good for maneurverability and rider load is bad for maneurverability.
	
	
	
	Computer Graphics Animation of the Bicycle Simulation: 
	
	A large part of the report is devoted to generating computer graphical
	animation of the biycle simulations. It was very state of the art!
	the climax is a camparison of an experimental and simulated bicycle
	slalom maneuver based on a strip chart of 6 images 0.2 seconds apart!
	the resemblance is striking! the simulated results were obtained
	by applying the following "bang - bang" control: the sign of the
	desired lean angle is opposite the sign of the current steer angle.
	lucky strike?? 
	
	
	Impressive results. unfortunately they do not elaborate on the rider
	control and validation but this is probably due to a lack of time
	and funding.},

  review = {JKM-Roland extends the bicycle model with many new features that allow
	a more accurate model of a Harley Davidson motorcycle to be produced.
	He runs simulations with a rigid rider and hands free riding at about
	80 mph where the motorcycle is perturbed with a lateral force at
	the saddle. The simulation results are evaluted on how well the weave
	motion behaves. These results were compared with experimental measurements
	of the motorcycle and rider. The primary goal of this report was
	to charaterize what and how various parameters affect the weave modes
	stability characteristics.
	
	
	- the model has eight degrees of freedom including rider lean, but
	they lock rider lean in these sims
	
	- a non-linear model is used with non-linear tire characteristics
	
	- the paper exams high speed weave instabilities (~80mph)
	
	- the model has capsize, weave and wobble modes (among others)
	
	- the wobble mode is speed independent
	
	- a bicycle model was extended to better represent the harley motorcycle
	
	- the model has three rigid bodies: upper body, frame and fork
	
	- model extensions beyond the whipple model: aero drag; aero lift;
	steer moment due to aero drag; driving thrust; tire forces that are
	functions of slip angle, inclination (camber) angle, and vertical
	load; gyro forces from engine; viscous steering damping
	
	- he claims to write the nonlinear equations in complete form but
	don't show them here
	
	- his model controls by steer and rider lean torques
	
	- these sims are done as rigid rider, hands free
	
	- claims that high speed weave can be studied independent of rider
	control since the freq is high
	
	- he measured the physical parameters of the motorcycle including
	determining moments of inertia using a torsional pendulum
	
	- there are three tire coefficients: slip angle-side force, slip angle
	cubed-side force and inclination angle-side force. I am not sure
	what the second is.
	
	- he choses 17 parameters to examine
	
	- he shows steer and roll angle plots for the simulations and experiments
	
	- he measured steer angle, roll angle, lateral accel and speed on
	the motorcycle
	
	- he tried to change the parameters independently
	
	- i am not sure how the complicated motorcycle model allows the weave
	mode to go unstable at high speeds, in the whipple model it gets
	more stable and speed increases
	
	- he compares the times required for the roll angle to half or double
	and the roll angle initial amplitude for $\pm$20\% change in each
	parameter
	
	- he classifies the parameters either as having an insignificant effect
	or significant
	
	- he discusses some consquences of not being able to realistically
	adjust parameters independently
	
	- says weight distribution is the most critical to weave stability
	with others that are important: wheelbase, rake, trail, fork inertia
	and CoM
	
	- used real tire data from Dunlop for his nonlinear tire model
	
	
	This seems like a decent study, but this paper lacks too many details
	to be of much use. The basic conclusion is still only that the bicycles
	parameters are very intertwined and it isn't very easy to pin down
	which parameters affect what dynamics. He says "Therefore, the most
	practical improved motorcycle design will consist of a coordinated
	set of modifications involving small changes in several critical
	parameters. Such a design can eliminate the weave oscillation from
	the operating speed range without increasing the tendency to wobble
	or adversely affecting handling performance". This alludes to the
	fact that each motorcycle has to be looked at individually and the
	critical parameters determined and adjusted and also that there may
	be some trade-offs between stable modes and handling. He finds that
	a high motorcycle cg is good for weave stability but bad for handling.},

	To realize a design that could be used during actual off-road cycling,
	a popular clipless pedal available commercially was modified so that
	both the form and the function of the original design were maintained.
	To measure the load components of interest, the pedal spindle was
	replaced with a spindle fixed to the pedal body and instrumented
	with 8 strain gages connected into 2 Wheatstone bridge circuits.
	The new spindle is supported by bearings in the crank arm. Static
	calibration and a subsequent accuracy check revealed root mean square
	errors of less than 1 percent full scale (FS) when only the force
	components of interest were applied. Application of unmeasured load
	components created an error less than 2 percent FS. The natural frequency
	with half the weight of a 75 kgf person standing on the pedal was
	greater than 135 Hz. These performance capabilities make the dynamometer
	suitable for measuring either pedaling loads due to the rider's muscular
	action or inertial loads due to surface-induced acceleration. To
	demonstrate this suitability, sample pedal load data are presented
	both for steady-state ergometer cycling and coasting over a rough

	To test this hypothesis, pedal load and lower limb kinematic data

	platforms mounted on a six-load-component dynamometer. One of the
	four platforms did not allow any relative foot/pedal movement while
	the other three permitted either medial/lateral translation, adduction/abduction
	rotation or inversion/eversion rotation. Three-dimensional intersegmental
	knee loads were computed for each of the four platforms using a previously
	reported biomechanical model. A number of quantities describing each
	of the intersegmental knee load components was computed and compared
	using analysis of variance techniques. The key results were that
	the medial/lateral translation platform did not cause significant
	differences in intersegmental knee load quantities relative to those
	for the fixed platform. However, both of the platforms permitting
	rotations significantly reduced many but did not significantly increase
	any intersegmental knee load quantities. Of these two platforms,
	the adduction/abduction platform significantly reduced both the axial
	and varus/valgus knee moments while the inversion/eversion platform
	significantly reduced only varus/valgus moments. These results have
	application to bicycle pedal design where the goal is to reduce intersegmental
	knee loads, hence possibly alleviating overuse knee injuries.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis which motivated the work reported in this article was
	that neglecting pure moments developed between the foot and pedal
	during cycling leads to a substantial error in computing axial and
	varus/valgus moments at the knee. To test this hypothesis, a mathematical
	procedure was developed for computing the three-dimensional knee
	loads using three-dimensional pedal forces and moments. In addition
	to data from a six-load-component pedal dynamometer, the model used
	pedal position and orientation and knee position in the frontal plane
	to determine the knee joint loads. Experimental data were collected
	from the right leg of 11 male subjects during steady-state cycling
	at 90 rpm and 225 W. The mean peak varus knee moment calculated was
	15.3 N m and the mean peak valgus knee moment was 11.2 N m. Neglecting
	the pedal moment about the anterior/posterior axis resulted in an
	average absolute error of 2.6 N m and a maximum absolute error of
	4.0 N m in the varus/valgus knee moment. The mean peak internal and
	external axial knee moments were 2.8 N m and 2.3 N m, respectively.
	The average and maximum absolute errors in the axial knee moment
	for not including the moment about an axis normal to the pedal were
	found to be 2.6 N m and 5.0 N m, respectively. The results strongly
	support the use of three-dimensional pedal loads in the computation

	Overuse injuries have been intuitively linked to the anatomic structure
	of the foot because external loads are applied to the foot in cycling.
	Thus, the structure and function of the foot should dictate in part
	how the loads are transmitted to the knee joint. Therefore, it was
	hypothesized that patterns in knee loads are related to the anatomic
	structure of the foot. To test this hypothesis, peak knee loads (dependent
	variables) were related to anatomical variables (independent variables)
	through statistical analyses. This required first the detailed evaluation
	(i.e. measurement) of the anatomical structure of the foot and leg
	for 23 subjects. Next, three-dimensional knee joint loads were determined
	for a standardized riding condition. The results of the statistical
	analyses indicated that a group of cyclists with the most extreme
	inversion of the forefoot relative to the transverse plane developed
	significantly greater average posterior knee force and extensive
	knee moment. In addition, a number of anatomical variables significantly
	accounted for the variability in peak values of the posterior force,
	the extensive moment, the varus/valgus moment and the external axial
	moment. Based on these results, the hypothesis is accepted.},

  abstract = {Driving is a multitasking activity that requires drivers to manage
	their attention among various driving- and non-driving-related tasks.
	When one models drivers as continuous controllers, the discrete nature
	of drivers' control actions is lost and with it an important component
	for characterizing behavioral variability. A proposal is made for
	the use of cognitive architectures for developing models of driver
	behavior that integrate cognitive and perceptual-motor processes
	in a serial model of task and attention management. A cognitive architecture
	is a computational framework that incorporates built-in, well-tested
	parameters and constraints on cognitive and perceptual-motor processes.
	All driver models implemented in a cognitive architecture necessarily
	inherit these parameters and constraints, resulting in more predictive
	and psychologically plausible models than those that do not characterize
	driving as a multitasking activity. These benefits are demonstrated
	with a driver model developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture.
	The model is validated by comparing its behavior to that of human
	drivers navigating a four-lane highway with traffic in a fixed-based
	driving simulator. Results show that the model successfully predicts
	aspects of both lower-level control, such as steering and eye movements
	during lane changes, and higher-level cognitive tasks, such as task
	management and decision making. Many of these predictions are not
	explicitly built into the model but come from the cognitive architecture

	forces are key variables in the design of traction, braking, and

	emerging of the ldquosmart-tirerdquo concept (tire with embedded

	a more direct estimation of contact forces. In this field - still

	and the choice of the regressor(s) to be used for force estimation.
	The objective of this work is to present a new sensor-regressor choice,
	and to provide some preliminary experimental results, which confirm
	the validity of this choice. The idea is to use a wheel encoder and
	an accelerometer mounted directly in the tire. The measurement of
	the in-tire acceleration is transmitted through a wireless channel.
	The key innovative concept is to use the phase shift between the
	wheel encoder and the pulse-like signals provided by the accelerometer

	36 ± 13.5 SD) and age and gender-matched normal subjects under static

	displacement was recorded and body sway analysed. Under dynamic conditions,
	subjects rode a platform continuously moving in the antero-posterior
	direction, with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC). Balance was inferred
	by the movement of markers fixed on malleolus, hip and head. Amplitude
	of oscillation and cross-correlation between body segment movements
	were computed. During stance, in normal subjects body sway was larger
	EC than EO. In blind subjects, sway was similar under both visual
	conditions, in turn similar to normal subjects EC. Under dynamic
	conditions, in normal subjects head and hip were partially stabilized

  abstract = { This paper addresses the influence of a passive rider on the lateral
	dynamics of a bicycle model and the controllability of the bicycle
	by steer or upper body sideway lean control. In the uncontrolled
	model proposed by Whipple in 1899, the rider is assumed to be rigidly
	connected to the rear frame of the bicycle and there are no hands
	on the handlebar. Contrarily, in normal bicycling the arms of a rider
	are connected to the handlebar and both steering and upper body rotations
	can be used for control. From observations, two distinct rider postures
	can be identified. In the first posture, the upper body leans forward
	with the arms stretched to the handlebar and the upper body twists
	while steering. In the second rider posture, the upper body is upright
	and stays fixed with respect to the rear frame and the arms, hinged
	at the shoulders and the elbows, exert the control force on the handlebar.
	Models can be made where neither posture adds any degrees of freedom
	to the original bicycle model. For both postures, the open loop,
	or uncontrolled, dynamics of the bicycle–rider system is investigated
	and compared with the dynamics of the rigid-rider model by examining
	the eigenvalues and eigenmotions in the forward speed range 0–10 m/s.
	The addition of the passive rider can dramatically change the eigenvalues
	and their structure. The controllability of the bicycles with passive
	rider models is investigated with either steer torque or upper body
	lean torque as a control input. Although some forward speeds exist
	for which the bicycle is uncontrollable, these are either considered
	stable modes or are at very low speeds. From a practical point of
	view, the bicycle is fully controllable either by steer torque or
	by upper body lean, where steer torque control seems much easier
	than upper body lean. },

  abstract = {After some brief history, a mathematical model of a bicycle that has
	become a benchmark is described. The symbolic equations of motion
	of the bicycle are given in two forms and the equations are interpreted,
	with special reference to stability. The mechanics of autostabilization
	are discussed in detail. The relationship between design and behavior
	is shown to be heavily speed-dependent and complex. Using optimal
	linear preview control theory, rider control of the bicycle is studied.
	It is shown that steering control by an optimal rider, especially
	at low speeds, is powerful in comparison with a bicycleÂs selfsteering.
	This observation leads to the expectation that riders will be insensitive
	to variations in design, as has been observed in practice. Optimal
	preview speed control is also demonstrated. Extensions to the basic
	treatment of bicycle dynamics in the benchmark case are considered
	so that the modeling includes more realistic representations of tires,
	frames, and riders. The implications for stability predictions are
	discussed and it is shown that the moderate-speed behavior is altered
	little by the elaborations. Rider control theory is applied to the
	most realistic of the models considered and the results indicate
	a strong similarity between the benchmark case and the complex one,
	where they are directly comparable. In the complex case, steering
	control by rider-lean-torque is feasible and the results indicate
	that, when this is combined with steer-torque control, it is completely

  review = {JKM - Robin Sharp used the benchmark bicycle model and an LQR controller
	with preview to make a bicycle track a 4 meter lane change at 6 m/s.
	During this manuever, the steer toque ranged from about -1 to 1 Nm.
	He also showed a very fine steer torque variation in the range of
	0 to 0.0025 Nm about 10 meters before the start of the lane change.
	
	
	Interesting to note that the steer rate gain is relatively very small
	compared to the steer angle, roll angle and roll rate gains, for
	pretty much all speeds. Seems to be true for tight, medium and loose
	control.
	
	
	He writes the characteristic equation of the Whipple model as an analytic
	quartic polynomial. Where he's reduced the number of parameters with
	a gyrostat formulation and even talks about reduced parameter space
	using Buckingham's pi theorem.
	
	
	Why doesn't he calculate the eigenvalues at zero speed?
	
	
	He points out that there is a proper distinction between steer angle
	and steer torque when talking about countersteering. In Limebeer2006,
	he talks about the two steer torque interpretations: the first being
	the initially opposite steer torque application and the secon is
	a high speed phenomna were you have to reverse the initial torque
	to maintain a steady turn. I'm not sure what happens with the steer
	angle in these two cases.
	
	
	He says that rider control of a fixed steering bicycle is not theorectically
	impossible.
	
	
	Bicycle design has little influence over controllability. He claims
	this because at slow speeds the control action of the rider is much
	stronger that the auto control provided by the bicycle.
	
	
	Fig 16 shows steer angle as the small magnitude. Here he shows a tiny
	counter steer torque in the lane change.
	
	
	He shows that acceleration/deceleration and tire crown radius after
	the open loop poles a lot. Sometimes removing the autostable region.
	
	
	He adds a tire model with tire width, side slip and relaxation. The
	tire width doesn't seem to change things much but the side slip affects
	the higher speed weave mode.
	
	
	Rider compliance with stiffness and damping on a leaning rider affect
	the higher speed weave mode, but don't affect the low speed weave
	mode much.
	
	
	Gains for steer torque control are much the same regardless if there
	is rider lean control involved too. The rider lean torque gains are
	relatively small when both controls are allowed. High gains are needed
	for low speed rider lean torque only control.
	
	
	The gain magintudes are basically ordered as follows with the first
	having the highest magnitudes for the loose control:
	
	
	roll angle and roll rate
	
	rider lean angle and lean rate, frame twist angle
	
	steer angle
	
	steer rate and frame twist rate
	
	
	Figures 27-30 might be labled wrong as they should related to different
	q1 values and control authority.
	
	
	Rider lean torque control requires three times the preview for equal
	control weighting.
	
	
	His cost function is based on minimizing the error in the path for
	a finite amount of preview times and minimizing the control power.},

  review = {JKM - The objective of this work was to derive and control scheme
	that somewhat represents what a motorcycle rider does which is both
	simple and effective. SImplicity for computation's sake and effectiveness
	concerning how well the controller does what it is told to do. He
	uses steer torque and rider lean torque to control their pretty complicated
	multi-DoF motorcyle model by means of a LQR regulator with the addition
	of preview. He primarily looks into the preview aspect of the controller
	and determines optimal preview distances for various weigthings in
	the LQR.
	
	
	- his LQR is set up to minimize a weighted sum of tracking errors,
	rider lean angle and control power
	
	- the inputs are rider lean torque and steer torque
	
	- the control model is based of of muti-point preview car control
	models
	
	- without preview the controllers seem to require unrealistically
	high bandwidth
	
	- he cites Frezza on pg 374 as making an effective motorcycle controller
	
	- the commercial product BikeSim includes a gain scheduled PID controller
	with single point preview
	
	- the standard LQR formulation is used along with a body fixed coordinate
	system that works well with path tracking (even complex paths) and
	small angle linearization
	
	- the preview is setup to view as if you are the motorcyle
	
	- the MATLAB DLSIM function is used with a discrete model
	
	- he uses a Magic Forumula for the tire models based on Pacjecka that
	must be adopted to motorcycle tires
	
	- the controller includes a PI controller to maintain constant speed
	
	- claims to symboliccaly linearize a nonlinear model
	
	- the control weightings are for steer torque and lean torque. the
	state weightings are for absolute lean angle, relative lean angle,
	and the tracking error
	
	- zero preview gains show that no preview is needed for optimal control
	
	- he says he uses the appropriate linear trim state based on nonlin
	simulations for the linear model and uses these sims to make decisions
	about LQR weightings
	
	- he doesn't show an about the LQR gains, but says that roll angle
	and frame twist angle gains are the highest
	
	- he setups up models with tight and loose control with steer torque
	alone and steer torque plus rider lean torque.
	
	- he plots the preview gains versus preview distance for various speeds
	and control weightings
	
	- he shows that the necessary preview distance increases significantly
	with speed and that more preview is needed than with an automobile
	
	- the max preview gains shows which preview distance provides the
	most useful info...these change depending on tight or loose control
	
	- he claims that we control the motorcycle at the weave freq at high
	speeds...but we haven't necessarily seen this with bicycles
	
	- even when rider lean torque is added and even weighted more, the
	model doesn't change the steer torque behavior. i would intuitively
	think that if you had rider lean torque available to use, then you
	would reduce the control by steer, but this doesn't seem to be the
	case
	
	- he shows in Figs 7,8 that require preview distance only changes
	at high speeds for tight controls, not loose controls
	
	- the final section simulates a lane change and S-turn manuevers for
	various control weightings
	
	- he finds that trackin performance is not imporved by adding lean
	torque control and even when wieghting it higher
	
	- there are some nice input and state plots for the manuevers that
	can be compared qualitatively to measurements
	
	- he says that body lean torque as control is ineffective pg 379
	
	- the S-turn manuever really pushed the tight controller and cause
	50 deg roll angles, but Sharp claims the linear tire models were
	still valid in this non-linear region
	
	- his tight contoller show steer torques up to 60 N-m, lean torques
	up to 100 N-m, roll angles up to 20 degs, and steer angles up to
	10 degs
	
	- he gets identical path tracking with only steer torque input compared
	to steer and lean
	
	- says rider's no-steering movements contribute only in a passive
	manner
	
	- i wonder how he define's control power? he minimizes over this
	
	
	Robin Sharp uses a multi-degree of freedom motorcycle model and an
	LQR controller with preview to control a motorcycle moving at 30
	m/s through a 4 meter lane change and a 250 meter S-turn. For the
	lane change he gets torques ranging from about -20 Nm to 55 Nm for
	a more aggressive control and -4 to 6 Nm for less aggressive control.
	The S-turn gives torques from -40 Nm to 70 Nm with a sharp peak in
	torque in the middle of the S-turn.},

  abstract = {The article is about stabilizing and path-tracking control of a bicycle
	by a rider. It is based on previously published work, in which it
	has been shown how a driver's or rider's preview of the roadway can
	be combined with the linear dynamics of an appropriate vehicle to
	yield a problem of discrete-time optimal-linear-control-theory form.
	In the previous work, it was shown how an optimal 'driver' converts
	path preview sample values, modelled as deriving from a Gaussian
	white-noise process, into steering control inputs to cause the vehicle
	to follow the previewed path. The control compromises between precision
	and ease, to an extent that is controllable through choice of weights
	in the optimal control calculations.\\Research into the dynamics
	of bicycles has yielded a benchmark model, with equations of motion
	firmly established by extensive cross-checking. Model predictions
	have been verified for modest speeds by experimental testing. The
	established optimal linear preview stabilizing and tracking control
	theory is now brought together with the benchmark bicycle description
	to yield optimal controls for the bicycle for variations in speed
	and performance objectives. The resulting controls are installed
	in the bicycle, giving a virtual rider-controlled system, and frequency
	responses of the rider-controlled system are calculated to demonstrate
	tracking capability. Then path-tracking simulations are used to illustrate
	the behaviour of the controlled system. Tight and loose controls,
	representing different balances between tracking accuracy and control
	effort, are calculated and illustrated through the simulations.},

	Shows the classic eigenvalue plot, probably one of the earlier ones.
	
	
	He reports steady turn steering torques from -25 n-m to 2.35 n-m.
	These are all for the either 10 deg of roll angle or 10 deg of steer
	angle and 30 different parameter sets for speeds of 10 ft/s to 160
	ft/s.
	
	
	DLP -- Sharp presents numerical results for 30 different variations
	of his standard motorcycle model. His model is similar to the Meijaard
	model in that it includes knife-edged wheels and a rigidly attached
	rider, but it differs by including a tire model which allows for
	lateral side-slip (and also encompasses the relaxation length of
	the tire), a rotating engine flywheel, and a steering damper. He
	also presents steady turning steer torques for some of the 30 variations
	of the standard model, for various speeds, at what he calls Q=10
	degrees, presumable this refers to the steer angle, but I'm not completely
	sure on this because Q isn't the symbol he uses for steer angle,
	roll angle, and it isn't mentioned in the discussion or in the list
	of notation.\\
	
	
	He refers to two different types of control: fixed and free. By free
	control, I presume what he means is uncontrolled, and he makes the
	statement that "In the case of the motorcycle, the free control behaviour
	would appear to be relatively much more important, since the very
	small steer angles normally employed would make fixed control difficult,
	...". I'm not clear on what he means by fixed control, but from Figure
	8 and his discussion of it on page 324, it would seem that he is
	fixing the steer angle at zero and looking at the stability of the
	system under this condition.\\
	
	
	Table 1 presents the capsize mode damping coefficients, Tables 2 and
	3 presents the weave and wobble mode damping coefficients and circular
	frequencies. I'm a bit confused about presenting damping coefficient
	instead of damping ratio. It seems like he would also need to mention
	the mass term or the stiffness term in order to be able to calculate
	the damping ratio, further, I'm not exactly clear on exactly which
	equations this damping coefficient would be arising from, he doesn't
	state this information explicitly. It is also a bit confusing because
	a number of these damping coeffiencients in his tables are negative,
	not sure what this means, since typically the damping coefficient
	is positive.
	
	
	One interesting thing he points out that the wobble mode is 'almost
	independent of forward speed', which is in sharp contrast with the
	other modes.
	
	
	His tire model includes a relaxation length of 0.8ft, and this figure
	was obtained from the work of Labarre and Mills experimentally measurement
	of a 2.25" section, 12.5" diameter tire. This model of a the tire
	side forces essentially assumes that the tire side forces lag the
	steady state force predicted by a the sideslip model through a first
	order delay. We should read the 1991 paper by Sharp and Pacejka to
	further understand what sort of tire model we may want to include
	in our bike models.},

  abstract = {The primary purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis
	that cycling economy, as measured by rate of oxygen consumption in
	healthy, young, competitive cyclists pedaling at a constant workrate,
	increases (i.e. decreases) when the attachment point of the foot
	to the pedal is moved posteriorly on the foot. The of 11 competitive
	cyclists (age 26.8Â±8.9 years) was evaluated on three separate days
	with three anterior-posterior attachment points of the foot to the
	pedal (forward=traditional; rear=cleat halfway between the head of
	the first metatarsal and the posterior end of the calcaneous; and
	mid=halfway between the rear and forward positions) on each day.
	With a randomly selected foot position, was measured as each cyclist
	pedaled at steady state with a cadence of 90Â rpm and with a power
	output corresponding to approximately 90% of their ventilatory threshold
	(VT) (mean power output 203.3Â±20.8Â W). After heart rate returned
	to baseline, was measured again as the subject pedaled with a different
	anterior-posterior foot position, followed by another rest period
	and then was measured at the final foot position. The key finding
	of this investigation was that was not affected by the anterior-posterior
	foot position either for the group (p=0.311) or for any individual
	subject (p[greater-or-equal, slanted]0.156). The for the group was
	2705Â±324, 2696Â±337, and 2747Â±297Â ml/min for the forward, mid,

	control design is presented. The methodology begins with a reduced-order
	linear dynamic-inversion technique that is scheduled over the flight

	reduction in the number of state variables to be sensed or estimated
	as compared to typical applications of inverse dynamic control. The
	technique can provide desired input-output characteristics including
	control decoupling. The required gain scheduling of the reduced order
	dynamic inversion is straightforward. Uncertainty is introduced by
	perturbing the stability derivatives in the vehicle model at each
	of the flight conditions considered. The effects of uncertainty are
	then reduced by additional feedback loops involving a diagonal compensation
	matrix obtained through application of a loop shaping procedure based
	upon a quantitative feedback theory predesign technique. The tendency
	of quantitative feedback theory to produce high-bandwidth conservative
	designs is mitigated by the scheduling and decoupling associated
	with the dynamic inversion. Finally, handling qualities and pilot-induced
	oscillation tendencies are evaluated using a structural model of
	the human pilot implemented in an interactive computer program that
	can include the effects of nuisance nonlinearities such as actuator

  number = {9},
  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to (1) determine whether bilateral
	asymmetry in cycling changed systematically with pedaling rate, (2)
	determine whether the dominant leg as identified by kicking contributed
	more to average power over a crank cycle than the other leg, and
	(3) determine whether the dominant leg asymmetry changed systematically
	with pedaling rate. To achieve these objectives, data were collected
	from 11 subjects who pedaled at five different pedaling rates ranging
	from 60 to 120Â rpm at a constant workrate of 260Â W. Bilateral pedal
	dynamometers measured two orthogonal force components in the plane
	of the bicycle. From these measurements, asymmetry was quantified
	by three dependent variables, the percent differences in average
	positive power (%AP), average negative power (%AN), and average crank
	power (%AC). Differences were taken for two cases -- with respect
	to the leg generating the greater total average for each power quantity
	at 60Â rpm disregarding the measure of dominance, and with respect
	to the dominant leg as determined by kicking. Simple linear regression
	analyses were performed on these quantities both for the subject
	sample and for individual subjects. For the subject sample, only
	the percent difference in average negative power exhibited a significant
	linear relationship with pedaling rate; as pedaling rate increased,
	the asymmetry decreased. Although the kicking dominant leg contributed
	significantly greater average crank power than the non-dominant leg
	for the subject sample, the non-dominant leg contributed significantly
	greater average positive power and average negative power than the
	dominant leg. However, no significant linear relationships for any
	of these three quantities with pedaling rate were evident for the
	subject sample because of high variability in asymmetry among the
	subjects. For example, significant linear relationships existed between
	pedaling rates and percent difference in total average power per
	leg for only four of the 11 subjects and the nature of these relationships
	was different (e.g. positive versus negative slopes). It was concluded
	that pedaling asymmetry is highly variable among subjects and that
	individual subjects may exhibit different systematic changes in asymmetry
	with pedaling rate depending on the quantity of interest.},

  title = {Gyroscopic Stabilization of Unstable Vehicles: Conﬁgurations, Dynamics,
	and Control},
  institution = {University of Michigan, Ann Arbor},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {We consider active gyroscopic stabilization of unstable bodies such
	as two-wheeled monorails, twowheeled cars, or unmanned bicycles.
	It has been speculated that gyroscopically stabilized monorail cars
	
	would have economic advantages with respect to birail cars, enabling
	the cars to take sharper curves and
	
	traverse steeper terrain, with lower installation and maintenance
	costs. A two-wheeled, gyro-stabilized
	
	car was actually constructed in 1913.
	
	The dynamic stabilization of a monorail car or two-wheeled automobile
	requires that a torque acting
	
	on the car from the outside be neutralized by a torque produced within
	the car by a gyroscope. The
	
	gyroscope here is used as an actuator, not a sensor, by using precession
	forces generated by the gyroscope.
	
	When torque is applied to an axis normal to the spin axis, causing
	the gyroscope to precess, a moment
	
	is produced about a third axis, orthogonal to both the torque and
	spin axes. As the vehicle tilts from
	
	vertical, a precession-inducing torque is applied to the gyroscope
	cage such that the resulting gyroscopic
	
	reaction moment will tend to right the vehicle. The key idea is that
	motion of the gyroscope relative to
	
	the body is actively controlled in order to generate a stabilizing
	moment.
	
	This problem was considered in 1905 by Louis Brennan [1]. Many extensions
	were later developed,
	
	including the work by Shilovskii [2], and several prototypes were
	built. The di!erences in the various
	
	schemes lie in the number of gyroscopes employed, the direction of
	the spin axes relative to the rail, and
	
	in the method used to produce precession of the spin axes.
	
	We start by deriving the equations of motion for a case where the
	system is formed of a vehicle, a
	
	load placed on the vehicle, the gyroscope wheel, and a gyroscope cage.
	We allow for track curvature
	
	and vehicle speed. We then derive the equations for a similar system
	with two gyroscopes, spinning in
	
	opposite directions and such that the precession angles are opposite.
	We linearize the dynamics about a
	
	set of equilibrium points and develop a linearized model. We study
	the stability of the linearized systems
	
	and show simulation results. Finally, we discuss a scaled gyrovehicle
	model and testing.},

	Shows an added feature to the system which projects a moving vertical
	line on the wall in front of the simulator. The rider's control actions
	allow the line to be tracked, adding a basic tracking task to the
	roll stablizatoin task. He shows the formula for calculating the
	4 rider transfer functions from cross spectral densities of the measured
	quantities. "Variations in frequency range from 0.5 to 3 hz will
	be classified as remnant by the identification methods applied here".
	He felt like the error in the tracking transfer functions were probably
	high, but they didn't calculated them. There seems to be a peak at
	about 12.5 rad/s for the roll angle feedback transfer functions.
	These new experiments were done for 35 minute lengths instead of
	5 minutes as previous experiments were due to the new calculation
	methods of the transfer functions of the more complicated system.
	These estimated transfer functions for the roll angle feedback were
	much smoother for the previous shorter roll stablization tasks. The
	tracking error feedback TF estimates seemed to be poorer. He mentions
	that future plans are to send in a sum of sines as a forcing function
	to the system.

	They found descrepencies in the computed time delays from their new

	delays were smaller! The steer angle time delay for the free upper
	body motion was about half what it was in earlier methods (0.074
	s). They attribute this to the earlier method having a bias due to
	the remnant. The Bode plots from this study and the previous study
	didn't differ much. The fixed upper body time delay was around 0.2
	seconds (similar to eariler results) and the subjects reported that
	the control of the simulator required more conscious effort when
	in the back brace. The conclude that the upper body motions are probably
	important in nomral bicycle riding, maybe for controlling the rider's
	head position in space.

	a result of weight and muscular actions during pedalling. To test
	this hypothesis, five riders spanning a wide weight range rode a

	of pedal loads and five components of both seat and handlebar loads
	while riders rode three common cycling situations -- seated cruising,
	seated climbing, and standing climbing. Average, average maximum,

  review = {Each device uses 1 full-bridge setup for 1 direction, and 4 half-bridge
	setups for the other 4 directions. Figures 6 & 7 from the NI tutorial
	show these configurations:
	
	http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/3642
	
	This is how the setup is reduced to having 1 +/- power channel and
	5 +/- signal channels (for a total of 12 pins).
	
	The handlebars cannot measure force in the "axial" direction, which
	here is Fy (lateral force) but it can measure all of the other forces.
	
	
	The seatpost can measure all forces except for axial torsion. 
	
	For each device Stone writes that 4 independent half-bridges are used
	for for the 4 forces, and the one full-bridge for either axial force
	or torsion (pp 7-8, Stone). I think this would indicate that applying
	another full bridge to each device would allow us to also measure
	the "missing" load, as a full-bridge setup seems capable of measuring
	either axial load or axial torsion. 
	
	I am not sure why this was not done originally? 
	
	Page 81 in Stone shows the coordinate system for the seatpost (note
	that the axial direction is the "z" direction). Page 80 shows the
	coordinate system for the handlebar and page 105 shows how the bending
	moments were estimated. 
	
	Calibration of the setups takes care of resolving these forces; the
	attached page is missing from the Stone Thesis scan and shows the
	conversion matrices from voltages to forces/moments. This works due
	to assuming superposition is valid with the beams involved. 
	
	
	I don't think measuring the extra degree of freedom would interfere
	with the process in any sort of way. 
	
	Knowing the force and moment on the seatpost (and assuming the rider
	is stationary, I think) would allow you to calculate where the rider
	has moved to (the location of their force application will move,
	creating a bending moment, but the forces should not change). This
	might imply we want a really stiff seat (and not very squishy)? With
	significant deflections linear assumptions are no longer valid, and
	I think looking at the scale of the forces involved might indicate
	that we want to enforce this. 
	
	Also, as page 105 showed, moment estimation requires knowledge of
	where the hands are placed. It might be more beneficial, especially
	if we can get free strain gauges, to make our own instrumented handlebar
	(especially if we want to measure both sides to avoid having to record
	both and left and right handed runs), where we specify the hand locations.
	I think measuring all 6 degrees of freedom will be a good idea, as
	the only downside is finding the strain gauge amplifiers and having
	channels to record them. This might suggest that buying two of the
	cheapest 16-channel DAQ boxes will allow us to measure everything.
	Assuming we can deal with the amplifier/acquisition issue, having
	all the data available to us, so we don't have to screw around with
	doing left- and right- handed turns and averaging the two, will be
	worth the additional calibration time (and any future uses of the
	system). 
	
	To get an idea of the accuracy of the system, read Stone pp 109-10.
	This shows the accuracy they achieved when testing the calibration.
	The seatpost seems to have good accuracy when measuring moments,
	so maybe the idea of locating the rider with this could work (we
	could also test that before attaching something to the rider). We
	also will be measuring with a 16-bit ADC instead of the 12-bit ADC
	used in the paper. I'm not sure if this will give more accuracy or
	not to be honest, Luke would probably know though. 
	
	
	I guess in conclusion, we should buy two DAQ boxes if we want to measure
	both handlebars, and then measure all 6 d.o.f. on both sides of the
	handlebar and the seatpost. if you want to record a reduced set of
	data, a single DAQ box could be made to work, but I think the time
	saved by collecting all the force/moment data always from the start
	instead of discovering we need to have it later (like, after we have
	wired everything and calibrated the reduced set of measurements we
	want to use) will far outweigh the additional time/cost incurred
	by setting up everything at the beginning. I also think that it should
	be possible to add the strain gauges to measure the missing data
	from the seatpost, and it should be easy to setup strain gauges on
	our own handlebars (assuming we can get help from Hill and Hull).},

  title = {CyberBike},
  school = {Norwegian University of Science and Technology},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {The idea about the CyberBike came to Jens G. Balchen - the founder
	of the Department of Engineering Cybernetics (ITK) at NTNU - in the
	1980's. He wanted to make an unmanned autonomus bicycle, i.e. a bike
	that could run by itself. The idea was picked up by Amund Skavhaug,
	who started the CyberBike project in the late 80's. After being deffered
	for some years, the CyberBike has again gained some attention. This
	master's thesis is based on Hans Olav Loftum's and Lasse Bjermeland's
	theses at the spring 2006 and the autumn project of John A. Fossum
	the same year. The goal of the CyberBike project is to make the bike
	work as intended, i.e. as an autonomous unmanned bicycle. This thesis
	naturally share this goal, although the bike did not become able
	to take its first autonomous trip within the thesis' time frame.
	At the start of the work, the bike were already equipped with a suitcase
	of computational hardware on its baggage rack, a small QNX Neutrino
	OS image was installed on the industrial PC mounted in the suitcase,
	and drivers for the installed motors, tachometers and potmeters were
	written. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was intended to supply
	the control system with the necessary information about rotation,
	acceleration and position, and the unit was purchased for the purpose.
	Also a driver was written, but not properly tested. The IMU had to
	be installed and connected to the control system. The bike's control
	theory was developed, but had never been put into action outside
	computer simulations (due to the lack of acceleration measurements).
	The various tasks that had to be addressed emerged as the development
	process advanced. First, the IMU had to be connected to the system,
	by making a signal tranceiver circuit. A small printed circuit board
	was designed and laid out, mainly to include a MAX233CPP iC. Then
	the DB-9 serial connector on the bikes single board computer (Wafer-9371A)
	could be used to read the UART signal from the IMU as RS-232. Then
	some testing had to be done, and drivers updated. A better and more
	advanced IMU (referred to as the "MTi") was added to the project.
	This unit needed no signal converting circuitry, but driver development
	and testing still had to be done. To enhance the CyberBike's navigation
	opportunities, a GPS module was purchased. A signal transceiving
	circuit, similar to the one for the IMU, was made for this unit,
	as well as software to read out the measurements from the device.
	By the end of this thesis, no navigational algorithms are made, hence
	the GPS is currently not used, but available for future efforts made
	on this area. Some hardware related tasks was carried out, as connecting
	and implementing functionality to the pendulum limit switches, installation
	of a emergency stop switch and a power switch, purchasing and installation
	of two 12V batteries and a cooling fan. An operating system upgrade
	resulted in replacing the CyberBikePC's storage device, a compact
	flash card, with a mobile hard disk drive. Installation of a motor,
	for supplying torque to the rear wheel, included setup and tuning
	of a hardware based velocity controller in a Baldor TFM 060-06-01-3
	servo module. However; this task is not to be considered as accomplished,
	due to some unsolved problems on the system I/O-card's output channels
	giving the motor controller card its reference voltage. A bike model
	and controller realized in Simulink was made by Bjermeland. Hence
	communicaton between Simulink and the device drivers had to be established,
	and this was realized by using S-functions and Real-Time Workshop.
	Finally the controller could be connected to the actual bike, but
	there was too little time left to explore this thoroughly, and make
	the system work properly. However, a foundation is laid for further
	development of the control strategy, hopefully storing a bright future
	for the CyberBik},

	the desired trajectory, because there is no consideration with respect

	more sophisticated equipment, a realization of the trajectory control
	for the bicycle is important. From the viewpoint of an assist system
	for human motion, a unified control of posture and trajectory brings
	a sophisticated function to a bicycle, and a high-performance bicycle
	is expected to be a convenient vehicle, similar to a small car. This
	paper proposes two strategies to stabilize bicycle posture and trajectory
	control that realizes a straight-line tracking: one is a lateral
	velocity controller, and the other is a steering function controller.
	The validity of the proposed approaches is evaluated by simulations

	RT3100 which is an attitude heading reference system that uses the
	rate gyro, accelerometer and GPS along with a generic Kalman filter
	to provide estimates of the states/outputs. They consider this one
	the "reference" system and assume that it gives accurate estimates.
	The second is a simpler inertial measurment unit with only rates
	and acceleration output. They use the roll rate, yaw rate, and lateral
	and longitudnal accelerations along with their custom Kalman filter
	to estimate the states of the system.
	
	
	They measure the motorcycle inertial properties somehow, but don't
	tell how or give the numerical values. They measure the tire properties
	with some kind of truck that pulls a tire behind it but give no details
	or numerical values. He uses MADYMO software to estimate the inertial
	parameters of the rider.
	
	
	They design a complex mutlibody model using Matlab/Simmechanics. This
	model includes the magic formula tire model. It has 6 rigid bodies.
	The rider is assumed to be fixed to the main frame and rigid.
	
	
	He integrates his complex motorcycle model with a measured steer torque
	input as feedforward (open loop sim). He has "light" PID feedback
	controllers on steer torque and velocity to follow measured roll
	angle and measured speed, respectively. I'm not sure how his simulations
	don't blow up with the feedforward approach. Maybe the steer torque
	feedback keeps it in check, although he mentions that his steer torque
	feedback does little to nothing. He then compares the outputs of
	the model simulation with the measured data from the RT3100 and other
	sensors and shows very good agreement for two maneuvers: steady turn
	and slalom.
	
	
	They then develop a simplified motorcycle model with a modified Lagrange
	method to be used in their extended Kalman filter design. The description
	of the modeling on developing the model is poor and hard to understand.
	The aim of this is to design a simple filter based on minimal measurements
	that can accurately predict the states. They compare the results
	of their filter with the RT3100 output.
	
	
	Steady state turn shows less than 15 Nm steer torques. Slalom shows

  abstract = { In this paper, a new single-track vehicle, the Anaconda, is presented
	and modelled according to a multibody theory. This articulated vehicle
	begins with a traditional bicycle, called the head module, followed
	by a succession of so-called pedal modules (PMs) equipped with one
	rear-steered wheel. Each module is connected to the preceding one
	by a spherical joint. To assess its dynamic behaviour, the model
	of an Anaconda with two PMs is simulated under the EasyDyn framework,
	a multibody library based on the minimal coordinates approach. The
	simulation of such a vehicle cannot be performed without the riders’
	action, consisting of the torques applied on the handlebars. The
	latter is implemented through controllers designed by optimal control,
	from the out-of-plane dynamics of the vehicle going straight ahead
	at 20 km/h. First, two optimal controllers are determined separately
	for the Head Module alone on one hand and for the Pedal Module alone
	on the other hand. They are then implemented on the Anaconda and
	it appears that the vehicle is close to instability and that the
	handling of the pedal modules is delicate but humanly possible. Finally,
	the difficulty in riding the Anaconda is evaluated through the so-called
	rideability index, which increases, as expected, with the amount
	of PMs, and shows that good psycho-motor skills will be needed to
	drive the Anaconda. },

	dynamic system model (Wang and Hull, Vehicle System Dynamics, 25:3,
	1996) was used to evaluate the power dissipated by a single pivot
	point rear suspension while pedalling uphill on a smooth surface.
	By systematically varying the location of the pivot point, the relationship
	between power dissipated and pivot location was determined. The optimal
	location was defined as the location which resulted in the least
	power dissipated. The simulation results show that the power dissipated
	was very dependent on the height above the bottom bracket but not
	the fore-aft location of the pivot point. If the pivot point is constrained
	to the seat tube, then the optimal pivot point was found to be 11
	cm above the bottom bracket. Compared to a commercially available
	design, the optimal pivot point reduced the power dissipated from
	6.9 to 1.2 Watts. Furthermore, the optimal pivot point was found
	to be very insensitive to pedaling mechanics, and both the spring
	and damping parameter values. The optimal pivot point did, however,
	have a linear dependence on the height of the chainline; as the chainline
	height increased so too did the optimal pivot point height.},

  title = {Test platform design and control of a bicycle-type two-wheeled autonomous
	vehicle},
  school = {University of Ontario Institute Of Technology},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Bicycle dynamics and behaviors have been vastly studied through modeling
	and
	
	simulation. Due to the complexity, software models are often assumed
	subjecting
	
	to dierent nonholonomic constraints in order to simplify the models
	and control
	
	algorithms. A real life autonomous bicycle faces perturbances from
	the road, wind,
	
	tire deformation, slipping among other external forces. Limitations
	of simulations
	
	will not always allow these to apply. All these issues make the autonomous
	bicycle
	
	research very challenging.
	
	To study the bicycle control problems a few research results from
	the literature
	
	are reviewed. A nonlinear bicycle model was used to conduct control
	simulations.
	
	Model based nonlinear controllers were applied to simulate the balance
	and path
	
	tracking control. A PID controller is more practical to replace the
	non-linear con-
	
	troller for the balance control. Simulation results of the dierent
	controllers are
	
	compared in order to decide the proper control strategies on the hardware
	platform.
	
	The controller design of the platform complies with practicality based
	on the hard-
	
	ware conguration. Two control schemes are implemented on the test
	platform;
	
	both are developed with PID algorithms. The rst scheme is a single
	PID control
	
	loop in which the controller takes the roll angle feedback and balances
	the running
	
	platform by means of steering. If the desired roll angle is zero the
	controller will try
	
	to hold the platform at the upright position. If the desired roll
	angle is non-zero
	
	the platform will be balanced at an equilibrium roll angle. A xed
	roll angle will
	
	lead to a xed steering angle as the result of balance control. The
	second scheme
	
	is directional control with balance consisting of two cascaded PID
	loops. Steering
	
	is the only means to control balance and direction. To do so the desired
	roll an-
	
	gle must be controlled to achieve the desired steering angle. The
	platform tilts to
	
	the desired side and steering follows to the same side of the tilt;
	the platform can
	
	then be lifted up by the centrifugal force and eventually balanced
	at an equilibrium
	
	roll angle. The direction can be controlled using a controlled roll
	angle. Many im-
	
	plementation issues have to be dealt with in order for the control
	algorithm to be
	
	functional. Dynamic roll angle measurement is implemented with complementary
	
	internal sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). Directional information
	is obtained
	
	through a yaw rate gyroscope which operates on the principle of resonance.
	To mon-
	
	itor the speed of the platform, a rotational sensor was formed by
	using a hard drive
	
	stepper motor attached to the axis of the vehicle's driving motor.
	The optoelec-
	
	tronic circuit plays the vital role to ensure the system functionality
	by isolating the
	
	electromagnetic noise from the motors. Finally, in order to collect
	runtime data, the
	
	wireless communication is implemented through Bluetooth/RS232 serial
	interface.
	
	The data is then plotted and analyzed with Matlab. Controller gains
	are tuned
	
	through numerous road tests.
	
	Field test results show that the research has successfully achieved
	the goal of
	
	testing the low level control of autonomous bicycle. The developed
	algorithms are
	
	able to balance the platform on semi-smooth surfaces},

  review = {JKM - Looks at the lateral dynamics of a motorcycle and rider control
	actions for keeping the bike upright and following a path at constant
	speed. Uses a model similar to Sharp's 1971 model. He uses the linear
	upright constant forward speed equations. The model has four degrees
	of freedom: lateral velocity, roll angle, heading rate, and steer
	angle. The inputs can be: steer angle, steer torque, and rider upper
	body lean angle. The model includes neuromuscular delays for the
	arm/hand lag and the upper body lag where the later is 3 times the
	former. The model has 7 rigid bodies: front wheel, rear wheel, engine
	rotor, fork/handlebar, rear frame, rider upper body and rider lower
	body. Linearizing decouples the longitudinal (pitch and heave) motions
	from the lateral motions. The control model wasn't considered unique,
	as it will vary with rider, vehicle and task. Quasi-linear model
	of the operator based on the crossover model is used. He neglects
	the remnant based on some assumptions (p 255). He set up various
	combinations of inputs and outputs for SISO human operator model
	to grade the quality of the controllers. Grading was based on stability
	margins, bandwidth, low freq properties, the presence of nuisance
	modes, etc. Table I (p257) shows these grades. It is only done for
	a single speed which is not reported. The steer torque to roll angle
	was by far the best. The rider lean to roll angle and to heading
	rate were the next best but may require large rider lean angles.
	It was interesting to note that steer angle to roll angle was ranked
	poor, he even says it has an adverse effect. This should be done
	for the bicycle case and various speed regimes and including some
	other possible rider inputs. We could grade these using some sort
	of control "effort" too. Would be interesting to set up experiments
	that only allowed this SISO control and see what the human percieves
	as best and what they perform the best with. He then setup a multi-loop
	model with steer torque to roll angle as the inner loop. The outer
	loops were closed by using rider lean to heading rate and lateral
	position deviation. The inner loop stablizes the capsize mode (why
	is the best controller used to stabilize the easiest to control instability?)
	and equalizes the system. The system uses gain only equalization
	and has good performance. He claims the high freq weave and wobble
	modes are byond the rider's control ability. Also, that the capsize
	mode should be stable without a rider for minimum rider workload.
	He mentions speed should be taken into consideration because the
	dynamics change. He derives an analytical solution to for the trail
	that would make the capsize mode small.\\
	
	Page 249\\
	
	
	- says the capsize mode is low frequency...does this happen because
	of the extra DoF's
	
	- says weave and wobble modes are high frequency...weave in our models
	isn't typically high freq
	
	
	Other notes\\
	
	
	- ``Note that the high speed `wobble' problem occasionally experienced
	may actually reflect a weave mode instability'' (p261)
	
	- Lateral acceleration is a poor sensory feedback because of lag
	
	
	This is the closest work that I have seen to what we want to do with
	the bicycle rider system. We should find all his papers and study
	the thesis in detail, using this work as a basis for our own.
	
	
	DLP - A summary work of his thesis. The modeling details are not included
	in this paper, for this (and other things) see his thesis. His model
	includes 4 degrees of freedom: lateral velocity, roll angle, heading
	rate, front fork steer angle. I'm not clear on what he means by these
	'degrees of freedom' since they are different types of variables
	(two are rates, two are angles). He considers three types of rider
	input: front fork angle, steer torque, and upper body lean angle.
	He then goes on to consider SISO transfer functions from those three
	inputs to the outputs roll angle, steer angle, heading angle, lateral
	position, heading rate, lateral velocity, and lateral acceleration.
	He finds that controlling roll angle with steer torque is the best
	choice, with controlling heading rate and roll angle via rider lean
	being good alternatives (or to be used in addition to roll angle
	control via steer torque), with all the other choices being very
	poor. He doesn't examine rider lean torque as a means to control
	the bicycle but for the autonomous bicycle, this should be investigated.
	For both my experiments and Jason's we need to figure out how to
	measure and command torque. In Jason's case, measuring the torqe
	applied by the rider, in my case, being able to command a motor torque.
	This is the control input I used for my ASME2008 paper where I extended
	the benchmark model to include a leaning rider},

  review = {JKM- This thesis has three four chapters. The first is the intro.
	The second describes human operator control models and how they relate
	to a motorcycle's dynamics and handling characterisitics. The third
	looks a specific motorcycle case, a chopper, and how changing its
	design affects the dynamics and handling. The 4th is the conclusion.
	There are two appendices: deviration of the linear equations of motion
	and the details of the numerical example used in the text. The basic
	theme is that you can use the basic crossover model to build a good
	multi-loop model that represents the motorcycle/rider system and
	use this info to develop design criteria.
	
	
	Chapter 2:
	
	
	- He looks at a unique model (i.e. specific motorcycle and human parameters)
	not a broad range
	
	- He assumes that you can model the rider control system with the
	crossover model and neglect the remnant so you are dealing with a
	completely linear operator model
	
	- In general strictly gain equalization is used, but he also talks
	about lead and lag equalization
	
	- His primary inputs are rider lean angle and steer torque for the
	dynamic model construction
	
	- He includes linear tire dynamics (based on slip angle) which add
	two degrees of freedom (later velocity and heading rate) to the whipple-like
	model. He adds a rider lean but without adding a new body...so the
	MoI's and CoM's don't change with rider lean angle
	
	- The time lag for the rider lean is 3 times the one for steer torque
	(basically neuromuscular models)
	
	- He didn't find any reliable data on the neuromuscular system for
	the rider torso.
	
	- He uses a motorcycle model that is in good agreement with Sharp's
	1971 model and linearizes about the upright constant speed configuration
	
	- He picks a specfic numerical case to work with the motorcycle traveling
	at about 50 mph 
	
	- He sets up various SISO system models using the transfer functions
	from the motorcycle model and the basic crossover model and evaluates
	them on the basis of whether they are good manual control systems
	
	- He finds that using steer angle instead of steer torque as a feedback
	cue is bad. Steer angle feedback has very poor gain and phase margins.
	The capsize mode is mostly unstable.
	
	- He finds that the rider lean angle control in the SISO systems requires
	large lean angles
	
	- he found lateral acceleration feedback to make a poor control system
	and says that for this example it would be difficult to ride the
	motorcycle with eyes closed.
	
	- He finds that lateral ground contact deviation as feedback is poor
	(corresponds to our line tracking experiments)
	
	- The determines that steer torque to roll angle is the best SISO
	control system and that rider lean to heading rate and rider lean
	to roll angle are the next best systems (this is only for one speed:
	50mph)
	
	- He then models various mutli-loop systems and compares them for
	quality
	
	- He finds that the best mult-loop system feeds back roll angle to
	control steer torque, heading angle and lateral position to control
	rider lean angle, he only uses gain equalization
	
	- He concludes that rider is most needed to stabilize the capsize
	mode and that at this speed, weave and wobble can be anaylzed with
	open loop methods for a good model.
	
	
	Chapter 3:\\
	
	
	- This chapter goes over how the models are affected by speed variations
	and changing the design parameters of the motorcycle (changes it
	to a chopper style motorcycle)
	
	- He repeats that the capsize mode is the dominant parameter for roll
	control
	
	- He states some design criteria for good handling on page 64: capsize
	mode should have small inverse time constant, capsize mode should
	be stable open loop, weave and wobble should be well damped and higher
	frequencies than rider control, no adverse heading numerators that
	reduce gain margin or increase phase lag, the loops should provide
	desired crossover freq
	
	- the movement of the frame CoM affects capsize, rake an trail have
	mixe effects
	
	- table II charaterizes how various design parameters and speed qualitatively
	affect the open loop dynamics
	
	- All he says about speed is that it has an effect and the rider must
	adopt, he doesn't look at really low speeds
	
	- He changed the geometry and com's to make a `chopper' bike (didn't
	change MoIs)
	
	- He describes trail in detail and how it effects the capsize and
	weave modes (more negative trail can help, large positive trail is
	bad)
	
	- He develops an analytical expression for trail that makes the capsize
	inverse time constant go to zero (an analytical handling quality
	type equation), page 87, eq 34
	
	- Says increasing speed, increasing rake angle (not sure if this is
	frame or fork rake angle), and increasing front wheel polar inertia
	makes the capsize mode less stable.
	
	
	Chapter 4:\\
	
	
	- These are his conclusions
	
	- Capsize mode dominants the control loop
	
	- Finds the best SISO systems (as said already) but says high rider
	lean angles are need for the second two
	
	- Acceleration sensing probably isn't utilized
	
	- The steer torque to roll plus heading angle and lateral position
	to rider lean is his preferred multi-loop model
	
	- Develop some handling quality criteria including and analytical
	calculation for good trail selection
	
	- Steer angle feedback is bad, don't grip handlebars tightly and try
	to set the angle
	
	- Higher speeds require higher steer torque gains
	
	- He was able to design an unusual motorcycle and make it have similar
	handling qualities and control charateristics
	
	- Trail is an important parameter
	
	
	Bibliography: He seemed to have most of the references from before
	his time. He was aware of the good work. There are a bunch of manual
	control papers we might want to get.
	
	Appendix A: He derives the linear equations of motion of a motorcycle
	similar to Sharps1971 model (derivation is supposedly similar to
	Sharps) and he claims that the linear model is an adequate description.
	He doesn't model the rider's upper body as a rigid body, he only
	uses lean angle to exert a gravitaional lean control torque to the
	vehicle. This is expalined some on pages 102-103. This tire model
	seems to be the basic force proportional to the slip angle.
	
	
	Overall, this work is highly relevant to what we are doing with the
	bicycle. I think following his examples we could do similar anaylses
	of the SISO and MIMO systems maybe adding more speeds, more complex
	human operator models, looking at more inputs and outputs, etc.
	
	
	It is funny that he identifies steer torque to be the primary control
	input by comparing steer torque to steer angle input, but he only
	tries an effective rider lean angle input and doesn't look at an
	actual rider lean torque (maybe he didn't have a rider lean torque
	model).
	
	
	DLP - Weir uses a model of the motorcycle with four degrees of freedom.
	Two of the degrees of freedom are lean and steer, analogous to the
	benchmark model, the other two come from tire slip model which allows
	for lateral slip, and uses a lateral tire force model which is linear
	in the slip angle and the camber angle of each of the wheels. His
	model also includes a rider, but in his formulation this doesn't
	add a degree of freedom. The way he seems to do it is to keep the
	inertial properties constant even as the rider leans, but to consider
	the roll torque applied to the frame due to the gravitational force.
	In general terms, his formulation of the equations of motion seems
	excessively long, taking the better part of 30 pages and using a
	non minimal set of geometric parameters. His model has a total of
	26 inertial and geometric parameters and 4 more for the tire model.
	
	
	The most useful thing that he does in this paper is to consider a
	myriad of possible control strategies, and looking at the transfer
	functions from from several different inputs to several different
	outputs. In particular he notes what the steady state gain is for
	each approach, which provides a useful metric for comparing the effectiveness
	of each control input. He finds that rider lean to roll angle as
	an inner loop has a gain of 5-10 deg rider lean / degree of roll
	angle error, which he correctly states is way too much to be effective
	on this particular model. We should analyze how effective it is in
	the case of the bicycle parameters we measure, and we probably want
	to consider rider lean torque rather than rider lean angle. We will
	likely need to do some research on what the describing function for
	the rider will be for this input mode, but it seems like an important
	control technique that we should analyze.
	
	
	page 27 -- Wier states that in order to turn right, the rider needs
	to lean right. In my hands free yaw rate controller, I found that
	this was true initially, but that the steady state rider lean angle
	was dependent upon the velocity, so for some speeds the rider would
	end up leaning into the turn, while in others, they would be leaning
	out of the turn. Seems like this would be parameter dependent behavior.
	
	
	page 40 -- we should determine for the benchmark parameters what the
	rider lean torque per degree of roll angle/heading angle/heading
	rate error. This would help identify the effectiveness of the rider
	lean control on a bicycle. Also, a more physiologically justified
	choice of the mass distribution and hinge axis should be used for
	the leaning rider benchmark parameters.
	
	
	page 43 -- He mentions how pushing down on the handle bar grips corresponds
	to rider lean, this made me realize that the cause of the upper body
	lean may very well not be coming from a torque at the hips but instead
	from forces transmitted from the handlebar, through the arms, and
	to the torso. We should ask Ron how we could find what the describing
	function for this part of the human body.
	
	
	page 44 -- The choice of feedback loops is restricted here to ones
	that Weir feels are physically occuring when a human rides. We should
	compare what an LQR controller gain matrix ends up being and how
	similar the resulting transfer functions are. I seem to remember
	a fair number of 0 entries in my gain matrix when I did the yaw rate
	controller, and it seems like the LQR formulation may have some similarities
	with a controller obtained by a hand selected set of sequential loops
	closures would be.
	
	
	page 51 -- Mentions that the heading angle to steer torque has a nonminimum
	phase zero and so for this reason, lean angle is a much better way
	to control the heading angle since apparently it doesn't have this
	issue.
	
	
	page 54 -- Figure 19 has a commanded roll angle of 0, which doesn't
	seem like it is the right thing to do if you are trying to turn.
	By doing it this way it seems as though your controller is fighting
	itself -- a lateral path deviation error will create a non-zero commanded
	heading angle, which will in turn create a non zero rider lean angle
	command to the system -- which will induce a non-zero roll angle,
	but then the roll angle controller is acting to counteract this by
	trying to drive it to zero. Furthermore, from a more physical point
	of view, when I am trying to turn my bike, or perform a lane change,
	I don't get the sense that I am trying to keep a zero roll angle
	during that manuever, so commanding a zero roll angle seems wrong.
	
	
	page 57 -- He states that figure 19 is 'more satisfying conceptually,
	and more convenient analytically,' but doesn't state why.
	
	
	page 65 -- lots of qualitative words (' helpful', 'beneficial', 'too
	much', 'steering feel characteristics') about how changes in parameters
	affect the handling qualities.
	
	
	page 66 -- Table II, 5 eigenvales shown (distinct real), capsize,
	weave (complex pair), wobble (complex pair). Presumably caster (real
	distinct) mode is not shown, and the other two are zero.
	
	
	page 81 -- He mentions that the quadratic pair of zeros at 41 rad/sec
	are of no consequence, but I am not sure why this is the case exactly.},

	under 70 mph, but the data shows it for 40 mph. He says it was outside
	the scope of the study to adjust the analytical parameters of the
	models to better predict the measured data.
	
	
	He compares the ratios of steady state torque to various kinematic
	measurements (roll, steer, yaw) to predictions by the model. (also
	compares ratios of kinematic measurements too). He attributes the
	variance in the data to the noise in the steer torque and the very
	low magnitudes of steer torque. There are plots showing the differences
	in these values when adding a fairing, rear load and passenger. The
	number of data points are low for these and it is hard to see much
	difference.

	Measured roll angle with a free gyro. The rider was required to uncage
	and cage the roll angle gyro at the beginning and end of each run

	the shelf transducer mounted in special design. Steer angle with
	rotary potentiometer. Forward velocity with DC tach. Rider lean angle
	and rider pitch angle with rotary pot. Lateral position with movie
	camera. Lateral accerleration with accelerometer.
	
	
	Steady turning experiments: lots of plots steer torque to something
	ratios for forward speeds and with added loads (passenger) and farings.
	Handling difficulty generally increased with speed. Also measure
	path deviation to get and idea of how good the task objective was
	maintained.
	
	
	Does a lange change with no hands. The rider is supposed to just use
	his body. He notes that after the manuever the motorcycle rolls back
	and forth under the rider because the rider lean angle is equal and
	opposite the motorcycle roll angle. He says the rider lean alone
	is rather ineffective at making the lane change while steer torque
	is precise and efficeint. He says (pg 170) that novice riders let
	the motorcycle roll underneath them more than the experienced riders.
	
	
	Weir et al. designed an instrumented motorcycle with a torque sensor.
	The range was +/- 70 Nm with 1% accuracy and >10 Hz dynamic range.
	The crosstalk due to the other moments on the steer were removed
	with by utilizing two thrust bearings. It included stops to prevent
	sensor overload protection and weighed 14 Newtons. They comment that
	the handlebars are significantly rigid for their purposes. It was
	a modular design set up for multiple motorcycles. They comment on
	the range being too large for small amplitude inputs used in steady
	turning and straight running and that more sensitivity would be needed
	to measure these accurately. Weir used this to measure steer torques
	for two motorcycles at various speeds (>10 m/s) for steady turning
	and lane change maneuvers. The steady turning produced torques in
	the range of -10 to 30 Nm and the lane change produced -20 to 55
	Nm.

	bicycle safety experiments based on trafic situations and carried
	out on at the time currently available childerens bicycles. different
	bicycles for boys and girls are used. 
	
	
	children between the ages of 8 and 12 were tested on different bicycles
	at normal cycling speeds. tests included different types of straight
	ahead cycling and braking with and without extra added mass. all
	bicycles were fitted with a reverse pedel brake.
	
	
	First three experiments were carried out inside in a heated hall.
	riders had to try to stay in the 40cm wide 17m long straight track.
	the experiments were carried out 3 times tests were:
	
	A: riding in a straight line with right hand on steeringwheel and
	left hand pointing outwards (to indicate going left)
	
	B: same as A, but also looking rearwards over left shoulder. where
	the child had to count the number of fingures that the examiner held
	up and shout this out loud. 
	
	C. Braking in a straight line. a horn sounded when the cyclist had
	his/her feet in the horizontal position. from that moment on they
	had to stop as quickly as possible, but with 1 or 2 feet touching
	the ground when they had no speed anymore, and on top of this the
	feet had to be in the 40cm wide track. (simulate stopping in traffic
	between cars). 
	
	
	There are substantial differences between the different bicycle styles
	and also between the boys and girls bicycles. some of the boys bicycles
	are much less "safe" than the girls.
	
	
	D: brake test outside: ride 13kph, stop as quickly as possible, no
	instructions on the placement of feet. sometimes the bicycle has
	been fitted with extra mass to represent school usage. each child
	rode 3 different types of bicycle, and carried out the experiment
	3 times with each bicycle. for the bicycles with added weight the
	another 9 tests were carried out. all bicycles give similar results
	for no extra added weight. There is one bicycle that stops much better
	than all the rest: this is a boys bike that is fitted with front
	and rear hand brakes (no rear pedel brake).
	
	For the experiments carried out with extra weight (35kg for rider
	plus weight for bicycle sizes upto 46cm and 45kg for rider plus weight
	for bicycle sizes larger than 46cm). no real conclusions could be
	made as a the added weight was to much for the children and they
	became far more cautious!},

	first the ergonomics of bicycles is investigated and it is concluded

	therefore kids should try a number of bicycles and sizes before buying
	a bicycle.
	
	
	16 boys and 16 girls are used as test persons. 
	
	
	Experiments: experiments were carried out 4 times by each test guinnypig.
	
	a: riding in a straight line, right hand on handlebars, left hand
	extended to the left (to indicate going left) and looking over left
	shoulder and upon request recount the number of fingers shown by
	the experimenter. it is concluded that kids of this age are not very
	profficient in safely opperating in traffic in this manner. (they
	do not keep to the lane enough)
	
	b: evasive maneuver and emergency stop. the riders ride at normal
	cruizing speed in a central lane (40cm wide). when the cyclist has
	his feet horzontal, a horn is sounded and a traffic light on one
	of either side of the lane is lit. the rider then makes an evasive
	maneuver to this lane (also 40cm wide) and stops as quickly as possible
	- and places at least 1 foot on the ground (preferebly in the lane).
	no significant differences are noted between the different types
	of bicycle. 
	
	c: outside brake test. riding 13kph the child has to stop in a 50cm
	wide lane as quickly as possible. and put at least 1 foot on the
	ground (in the lane) main difference between girls and boys appear
	to be a much slower reaction time for girls using a revers pedel
	brake. double brake bikes stop quicker than singel (rear) brake bikes.},

  title = {Autonomous Bicycle Roll Angle Control System},
  institution = {Hope College Department of Engineering},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The goal of this project was to design an autonomous bicycle roll
	angle control system.
	
	By controlling the roll angle of a moving bicycle, stability can be
	obtained for autonomous
	
	operation. Such a device can be used as the basis for developing more
	advanced types of
	
	automatically-driven two-wheeled robotic vehicles which are important
	for military
	
	reconnaissance or space exploration applications. A functional bicycle
	stability control system
	
	may also aid in the design of stability-assistive mechanisms in future
	human operated two-
	
	wheeled vehicles for safer operation. Additionally, such a device
	can be used to explore
	
	research-related questions as pertaining to inverted-pendulum-like
	control or made use of
	
	pedagogically for engineering control system classes at Hope College.
	
	Several design requirements were evaluated to develop this bicycle
	roll angle control
	
	system. For the control system to function autonomously, all system
	components were required
	
	to be mounted onboard the bicycle, including power sources. An accurate
	means of measuring
	
	roll angular states was required, as well as an easily reprogrammable
	interface for implementing
	
	various control methods. The design also called for a low cost design,
	as the project budget was
	
	limited to $800. Safety was also a vitally important factor in determining
	the product’s design.
	
	Additionally, little modifications to the original bicycle and low-maintenance
	system
	
	components were also desired of the developed device.
	
	To formulate a feasible design for a bicycle roll angle control system,
	several concepts
	
	were considered. For programming control methods and acquiring system
	data, a laptop-
	
	LabVIEW setup, FIRST Robotics controller, and I/O microprocessor board
	were all considered.
	
	To measure the bicycle’s system states, the various conceptual designs
	included use of a rear-
	
	wheel cart with an attached potentiometer, an accelerometer and rate
	gyro combination,
	
	ultrasonic sensors, a hanging mass with attached optical counter,
	and a motion-tracking camera.
	
	As the proposed control system required actuating both the bicycle’s
	rear wheel and handle bar
	
	steering angle, various configurations of stepper, DC, and servo motors
	were considered for
	
	driving these control system features. The concepts also evaluated
	several means of transmitting
	
	torque from these motors. Other unique features considered with the
	conceptual designs included
	
	use of an existing electric-powered bike or running the device stationary
	on a powered treadmill.
	
	The final roll angle control system design makes use of an onboard
	laptop equipped with
	
	LabVIEW for data acquisition and control implementation. A weighted
	average of sensor
	
	readings from an accelerometer configured as an inclinometer and the
	discrete integration of a
	
	rate gyro is used to obtain roll angle measurements. The developed
	prototype utilizes a stepper
	
	motor to actuate the required steering angle and a DC window motor
	to drive the bicycle.
	
	Batteries are mounted onboard the bicycle to power all the devices.
	Circuits were developed to
	
	configure all the electrical components, and both digital and physical
	filtering methods were
	
	applied across the measurement sensors’ output signals. A least-mean-squares
	fitting algorithm
	
	was used to identify physical parameters of the bicycle system for
	control implementation. The
	
	control system components are all interfaced with a LabVIEW program,
	and a control method is
	
	implemented. Thus far, the control system has succeeded in stabilizing
	the bicycle for brief runs.
	
	As improved control methods are developed and implemented from root
	locus analysis and
	
	model simulations, the finished prototype device is fully equipped
	with all of the necessary
	
	hardware specifications for realizing effective roll angle control.},

  volume = {31},
  pages = {677 - 683},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of bicycle pedal
	design on the mechanics of the patellofemoral joint. Previous research
	determined that for certain riders the non-driving varus and internal
	knee moments could be reduced by switching from fixed to free floating
	pedals (Ruby and Hull, 1993). It was postulated that the presence
	of varus and internal knee moments during fixed pedal cycling may
	adversely affect patellofemoral joint contact mechanics which could
	lead to the development of anterior knee pain. To investigate the
	effect of pedal design the hypothesis that varus and internal intersegmental
	knee moments significantly increase patellofemoral contact pressure,
	contact area and contact force was tested. To test this hypothesis
	cycling loads were simulated in vitro using a six-degree-of-freedom
	load application system (LAS). Using the LAS, varus moments ranging
	from 0-20Â Nm and internal knee moments ranging from 0-10Â Nm were
	applied simultaneously with quadriceps force at knee flexion angles
	of 60 and 90 degrees. Patellofemoral contact patterns were measured
	using pressure sensitive film. An applied 10Â Nm internal moment
	significantly increased both contact area by 16% and contact force
	by 22% at 90Â° of flexion. The application of a 20Â Nm varus moment
	modestly yet significantly increased contact area by 6% and contact
	force by 5%. When applied in combination, varus and internal knee
	moments increased contact area and force by as much as 29% and 28%
	respectively. The mean contact pressure was not significantly increased
	by either of the two moments. The results suggest that non-driving
	intersegmental knee moments subject the patellofemoral joint to loads
	and contact patterns which may accelerate the development of chondromalacia.},

	due to its nonlinearities, unstability and nonminimum phase steering
	behavior. In order to design a linear controller for the bicycle
	circular motion, a linear bicycle model of circular motion is derived
	from fully nonlinear differential equations. The first step is to
	find an equilibrium roll angle and steering angle given the under
	turning radius and an angular speed of rear wheel relative to a rear
	frame. Then at the second step, roll and steering control inputs
	which maintain equilibrium are calculated. Finally the linearized
	equations of the circular motion are derived from Lagrange's equations.
	Some simulation results on the LQ linear control for the circular
	motion are demonstrated to show the validity of the proposed approach.},

	such systems conserve energy, but nonetheless can exhibit both neutrally
	stable and asymptotically stable, as well as linearly unstable relative
	equilibria. To carry out the stability analysis, we use a generalization
	of the energy-momentum method combined with the Lyapunov-Malkin Theorem
	and the center manifold theorem. While this approach is consistent
	with the energy-momentum method for holonomic systems, it extends
	it in substantial ways. The theory is illustrated with several examples,
	including the the rolling disk, the roller racer, and the rattleback
	top.},

	We first present the motorcycle dynamics with an accurate steering
	mechanism model with consideration of lateral movement of the tire/ground
	contact point. A nonlinear balance controller is then designed. We
	estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of motorcycle dynamics under
	which the stationary motorcycle can be stabilized by steering. For
	a typical motorcycle/bicycle configuration, we find that the DOA
	is relatively small and thus balancing control by only steering at
	stationary is challenging. The balance control and DOA estimation
	schemes are validated by experiments conducted on the Rutgers autonomous
	motorcycle. The attitudes of the motorcycle platform are obtained
	by a novel estimation scheme that fuses measurements from global
	positioning systems (GPS) and inertial measurement units (IMU). We
	also present the experiments of the GPS/IMU-based attitude estimation
	scheme in the paper.},

  abstract = {Sensory systems often provide ambiguous information. Integration of
	various sensory cues is required for the CNS to resolve sensory ambiguity
	and elicit appropriate responses. The vestibular system includes
	two types of sensors: the semicircular canals, which measure head
	rotation, and the otolith organs, which measure gravito-inertial
	force (GIF), the sum of gravitational force and inertial force due
	to linear acceleration. According to Einstein's equivalence principle,
	gravitational force is indistinguishable from inertial force due
	to linear acceleration. As a consequence, otolith measurements must
	be supplemented with other sensory information for the CNS to distinguish
	tilt from translation. The GIF resolution hypothesis states that
	the CNS estimates gravity and linear acceleration, so that the difference
	between estimates of gravity and linear acceleration matches the
	measured GIF. Both otolith and semicircular canal cues influence
	this estimation of gravity and linear acceleration. The GIF resolution
	hypothesis predicts that inaccurate estimates of both gravity and
	linear acceleration can occur due to central interactions of sensory
	cues. The existence of specific patterns of vestibuloocular reflexes
	(VOR) related to these inaccurate estimates can be used to test the
	GIF resolution hypothesis. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured
	eye movements during two different protocols. In one experiment,
	eight subjects were rotated at a constant velocity about an earth-vertical
	axis and then tilted 90° in darkness to one of eight different evenly
	spaced final orientations, a so-called “dumping” protocol. Three
	speeds (200, 100, and 50°/s) and two directions, clockwise (CW) and
	counterclockwise (CCW), of rotation were tested. In another experiment,
	four subjects were rotated at a constant velocity (200°/s, CW and
	CCW) about an earth-horizontal axis and stopped in two different
	final orientations (nose-up and nose-down), a so-called “barbecue”
	protocol. The GIF resolution hypothesis predicts that post-rotatory
	horizontal VOR eye movements for both protocols should include an
	“induced” VOR component, compensatory to an interaural estimate of
	linear acceleration, even though no true interaural linear acceleration
	is present. The GIF resolution hypothesis accurately predicted VOR
	and induced VOR dependence on rotation direction, rotation speed,
	and head orientation. Alternative hypotheses stating that frequency
	segregation may discriminate tilt from translation or that the post-rotatory
	VOR time constant is dependent on head orientation with respect to
	the GIF direction did not predict the observed VOR for either experimental
	protocol.},

	respect to uncontrolled stability using root locus and Routh's criteria.
	Found that caster and front wheel moment of inertia have great affect
	on stability, while rider position doesn't. Stabilized the model
	with rider lean as the input and feedback of parameters that would
	actually be used by a human rider. He built a robot bicylce but couldn't
	get it to stablize. He only derives the linear equation of motion,
	using Kane's method. Once he finds the velocities he linearizes and
	then computes accelerations and Kane's equations. He did a basic
	sensitivty study on the parameters for stability. The control law
	was not necessarily optimum, but attempted to gain stability of the
	greatest range of speeds. Lean torque is the output from the controller.
	He used rider lean angle and bicycle roll angle feedback. He tried
	proportional control for both and PD for both. He measured the inerital
	parameters of the robot bicycle with a swing/pendulum and a stop
	watch. He measured steer angle and roll angle with potentiometers.
	The roll angle was measured by pulling a small two wheel trailer
	behind the bicycle and measuring the relative angle of it and the
	frame. He decided not to use rate gyro's due to alignment worries
	and poor results from integrating the signals.},
