<h2>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the beginning of 2009 I was in Delft working with Jodi and Arend on much of
the work explained in the previous chapters. I was still also in contact with
Mont and Luke back in Davis. Before I&#8217;d come to Delft, Luke had mentioned the
possibilities of applying for an NSF grant to fund the remainder of our bicycle
dynamics projects. This was enticing, as Mont has not had much grant funding
over the years for his lab, preferring to work spend more time researching less
expensive endeavours than grant writing. We really needed some dedicated
research time, as we spent the first few years taking teaching assistance
positions which ate up most of our available research time outside of our
classes. I fortunately got a Fulbright grant for the 2008 school year which
gave me a year&#8217;s stipend so that I could focus on research and on top of that
Jodi&#8217;s PhD budget helped fund the practical research costs in Delft and some of
my conference trips. At the beginning of December 2008 Luke sent me an email
with a renewed interest in applying for the NSF grant and Mont seemed to be on
board. Mont also talked with Ron and got him interested. We spent the next two
months writing our grant proposal using video conferencing and collaborative
word processing to get it done. The basic idea was to pair Ron&#8217;s manual control
expertise with our bicycle dynamics expertise to study the dynamics, control
and handling qualities of bicycles with the theoretical constructs supported by
extensive experimentation. Our work paid off and we received the grant, albeit
at a smaller amount than asked for so we had to cut back some of the scope
(which Arend had correctly forecast of being too large!).  This set us up for a
two year study where we&#8217;d develop a manual control model, verify it and the
basic bicycle dynamics with both an instrumented bicycle and a robotic bicycle,
and wrap it up with some work on handling qualities predictions.</p>
<p>When I got back to Davis in September 2009 we started gearing up for the grant
work that would start October 1st. I had to get my qualifying exam done in
October and I also signed up for a Spanish class (which wasn&#8217;t necessarily a
good idea for the grant&#8217;s sake). Luke also took some programming classes and
this gave us a really slow start, as neither Luke or I realized that the scope
of what we had to do didn&#8217;t really allow any more time for classes. We got
moving though and started to plan out the bicycle(s) we were going to build.</p>
<p>Our proposal called for two bicycles, but somehow Luke and I hatched a plan to
build a single multi-purpose bicycle to &#8220;save money&#8221;. Arend sent Danique over
in January 2010 to do her internship with us. She was super bright and made
great progress on the custom data acquisition system we&#8217;d envisioned. We&#8217;d
decided to go fairly low level and use an Arduino paired with with a set of
digital sensors. During this time, Luke and I had our roughest moments working
together which was mostly rooted in my frustrations with the progress of this
bicycle design. I&#8217;d already built a bicycle with Jodi that did almost
everything I needed and I felt like I was reinventing the wheel and wasting
time with all this low level data acquisition work. Things eventually broke
down after the stress boiled to the top and we sat down with Mont to figure out
how to solve things. The conclusion was to split the bicycle back into two and
each of us move forward more independently. I think this was the absolutely
right move for me in terms of getting the project done as I&#8217;d planned and the
stress immediately went away. But the part I&#8217;m still bothered about was my
inability to work in a direct team with Luke when the pressure to get things
done was high. I know that if we work together, the final product would be many
times greater than our independent work because of our complimentary skill
sets, but conflicting visions of the final product and the path to get there
really put a wall between us. I&#8217;m continually learning how to do teamwork and
probably always will be. I doubt it is one of my strong points, as I always
tend to want control. I hope that I can develop strong team environments for my
students in the future too.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the instrumented bicycle moved forward. I was awarded an extra
grant to cover my stipend for the summer of 2010 and we used the NSF funds that
would have covered me to hire Gilbert, a new student in our lab, to help us out
for the summer. Between me, Gilbert and our undergraduate interns Mohammed,
Stephen, Eric, and Chet we plowed through the bicycle construction through the
summer pretty much putting the instrumented bicycle back on schedule for
experimentation in the fall. But even with the summer push, it ended up taking
me all fall quarter and some into the new year to get the bicycle in a working
state and ready for the experimentation. This chapter details all that went
into its design and operation of the Davis instrumented bicycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter details the design and implementation of an instrumented bicycle
capable of accurately measuring the essential kinematics and kinetics
associated with the human control of the bicycle.</p>
<p>I had originally considered using motion capture for the kinematics as we had
very successful results measuring the complete kinematic configuration of the
bicycle and rider with motion capture techniques as explained in Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="motioncapture.html#motioncapture"><em>Motion Capture</em></a>, but I no longer had access to a system as good as the one
at the Vrije Universiteit. The systems available here could capture the motion
on the treadmill but were not especially not suited to capture the motion of
the bicycle on the ground. With this in mind, we decided to expand upon the on
board measurement techniques used in the Delft Instrumented bicycle as the
basic design principal as this would allow the bicycle to collect data in a
variety of environments. The most notable downside was inaccurate location
tracking of the system. But we concluded that this wouldn&#8217;t be detrimental to
system identification and moved forward with the instrumentation.</p>
<p>The bicycle&#8217;s primary design criteria were as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sized for our intended riders: average adult males.</li>
<li>Restrict the rider&#8217;s biomechanical movement to more closely meet the Whipple
model rigid rider assumption. This in turn also requires the bicycle to be
self propelled so that the rider does not have to move their legs.</li>
<li>Accurately measure the rider&#8217;s applied steering torque.</li>
<li>Accurately measure the fundamental kinematics of the bicycle: three
dimensional rates and orientations of the bicycle rear frame, front frame and
wheels.</li>
<li>Accurately apply and measure a lateral disturbance force to the bicycle
frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>From early on, I intended to attempt some experiments with some constrained
rider biomechanical motion, such as leaning, because the interplay of the
various control inputs available to the rider are a common research topic with
little experimental backing. This led to secondary design criteria but as the
project progressed and they were never fully implemented, but I&#8217;ll discuss them
for completeness. They are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Restrict the rider&#8217;s body motion to a limited set and measure the additional
kinematics: hip roll, torso relative to hip lean, torso relative to hip
twist, and lateral knee motions.</li>
<li>Measure the additional reaction forces between the rider and bicycle: forces
and moments in the seatpost and forces at the foot pegs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria framed the subsequent design choices described herein.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bicycle">
<h2>Bicycle<a class="headerlink" href="#bicycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We needed a bicycle that would allow for easy modification and various mounting
points for sensors and data acquisition equipment. Our original requirements
for a bicycle were as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Steel frame for easy modification and welding.</li>
<li>Disc brake brackets for mounting the wheel speed encoders.</li>
<li>100mm front dropout spacing and 135mm rear dropout spacing.</li>
<li>1-1/8 threadless headset to allow for easy modification.</li>
<li>Round tubes for head, down, top, and seat tube (i.e. nothing non standard)</li>
<li>Ideally a horizontal top tube for equipment mounting purposes.</li>
<li>Threaded rack mount for instrumentation mounting.</li>
<li>Accept 700c high pressure tires.</li>
<li>Size: 54-58cm for our intended riders.</li>
<li>An electric hub motor for forward propulsion.</li>
</ul>
<p>We ended up choosing a large size Surly 1x1 model, Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#figsurly"><em>figSurly</em></a>. It
is designed as a single speed off road bicycle for 26&#8221; wheels with fat tires,
but can be setup with 700c higher pressure tires. The frame is constructed from
butted 4130 CroMoly steel tubing. It has both front and rear cantilever brake
mounts in addition to disc brake mounts. Otherwise it met all of our
requirements. We purchased some standard components including 700c aluminum
wheels with 23c Continental Gatorskin high pressure tires and basic handlebars
and brakes.</p>

<div class="legend">

Amped Bikes geared hub motor is shown installed along with the lead acid
battery kit on the rear rack.</div>
</div>
<p>To allow the bicycle to be propelled forward without requiring the rider to
pedal, we opted for a bicycle electric hub motor kit.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ampedbikes.com">Amped Bikes</a> graciously donated both direct drive and geared
kits which included the motors, controllers, throttle and 36 volt lead acid
batteries. I used the direct drive version on the instrumented bicycle. The
lead acid batteries were very heavy so we purchased a light, ~2.8 kg, 36 volt
lithium ion battery as a substitute to help decrease the over bicycle weight.
The kit comes with a motor controller with a rudimentary &#8220;cruise control&#8221;. We
needed some form of cruise control to allow the rider to set the speed during
the experiment and then focus their attention to lateral control as opposed to
throttle control. The Amped Bike cruise control worked well for the experiments
performed on the floor, but was more difficult to match the cruise control to
the speed of the treadmill. Some sort of feedback control would alleviate the
difficulties, but we made due. The exposed wires from the hub motor are also
easily susceptible to damage. The bicycle fell over once, damaged the wires and
shorted the hall effects sensors in the hub. I spent a couple of weeks
repairing it <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id83" id="id1">[1]</a>. Overall, the motor met our needs for constant speed
propulsion and the single battery would last an entire day of experimentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rider-harnesses">
<h2>Rider Harnesses<a class="headerlink" href="#rider-harnesses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The bicycle was designed to accommodate a range of allowable rider motions. I
designed it with three modes in mind. Firstly, the rider can simply have
complete free rider biomechanical motion as they would when normally riding a
bicycle. The second design was intended to restrict almost all of the rider&#8217;s
ability to move with respect to the bicycle frame to better mimic the rigid
rider assumptions in many bicycle models. And thirdly, a harness was designed
to restrict the rider&#8217;s movement to a particular subset of hypothesized
dominant motions.</p>
<div class="section" id="rigid-rider">
<h3>Rigid Rider<a class="headerlink" href="#rigid-rider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition-todo admonition" id="index-0">
<p class="first admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p class="last">city Stassen1973 for the rider brace</p>
</div>
<p>Rigid rider models are often employed in single track vehicle research but the
rider has been rigidified very few times in experimental work. This potentially
problematic as the rigid rider assumption is a large one. [Eaton1973c]
rigidfied his motorcyclists&#8217; torso and performed several perturbation tests
with the rider&#8217;s hands off the handlebars! He found it difficult to identifying
the linear modes of motion. [Doyle1987] comments on the utility of rigidifying
the rider which was very inline with his techniques to simplify the system, but
he left the rider free to move in his experiments. Jim Papadopolous has been a
proponent of using recumbent bicycles in studies due to the natural
rigidification of the rider. His thoughts and the difficulties we had in the
studies from Chapters <a class="reference internal" href="delftbicycle.html#delftbicycle"><em>Delft Instrumented Bicycle</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="motioncapture.html#motioncapture"><em>Motion Capture</em></a> influenced
my decision of restricting the rider&#8217;s motion.</p>
<p>I constructed a harness such that the rider was rigidified as much as possible
with respect to the rear frame. A medical back brace was used to rigidify the
spine and hip motion. I then attached the brace to the bicycle frame via a
stout adjustable arm.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/rigid-harness.jpg" src="_images/rigid-harness.jpg" style="width: 4in;" />
<p class="caption">figRigidHarness</p>
<div class="legend">
Me strapped into the rigid rider harness. The arm allows for multiple
degrees of adjustability to allow different riders and seating positions.</div>
</div>
<p>I fashioned some knee straps with strong magnets taken from computer hard
drives which would engage with a ferrous attachment plate on the frame so that
the rider&#8217;s legs would be rigid with respect to the rear frame. Chapters
<a class="reference internal" href="delftbicycle.html#delftbicycle"><em>Delft Instrumented Bicycle</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="motioncapture.html#motioncapture"><em>Motion Capture</em></a> showed the rider tends to use
lateral knee motions and we wanted to eliminate that as a confounding factor.
The magnets were weak enough that the rider could remove his legs in an
emergency.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">figKneeConstraints</p>
<div class="legend">
The left image shows the knee straps with hard drive magnets and the right
image shows the knee attachment plates mounted to the top tube of the
bicylce.</div>
</div>
<p>This left the rider&#8217;s arms and head free to move. The arm motion was required
for controlling the bicycle, although one could imagine fixing the rider&#8217;s arms
and only allowing control with motion of their hands. The head probably should
have been rigidified with respect to the body cast, but we didn&#8217;t due to
comfort reasons. Nonetheless, Jan had great plans for a halo like ring with
nails sticking through to the rider&#8217;s scalp so that they couldn&#8217;t move their
head without excruciating pain, we just never got around to making it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restricted">
<h3>Restricted<a class="headerlink" href="#restricted" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A second harness was partially developed to restrict the rider&#8217;s motion to that
described in <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#secflexiblerider"><em>Flexible rider (hip rotation, back lean and twist)</em></a>. A back brace which left the hips free to
move was used to keep the spine straight and a custom molded hip braced was
developed to hold securely to the hip bone. The plane was to attach the hip
brace to the bicycle seat via a revolute in the roll direction which would
allow the hips to <em>only</em> roll about the seat. The back brace would then be
attached to the hip brace via a joint which would allow torso lean with respect
to the hips. The feet would be attached to the foot pegs via clip in pedals.
Forces applied from the feet to the foot pegs would effectively allow the
rider&#8217;s hips to roll with respect to the bicycle frame (in reality because the
rider is more massive and more inert the bicycle frame would roll with respect
to the inertial reference frame).</p>
<div class="admonition-todo admonition" id="index-1">
<p class="first admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p class="last">take a photo of the partially constructed brace</p>
</div>
<p>My hypothesis was that this restricted motion would be all that would be needed
to effective control the bicycle with no hands and would provide the next
effective means of control along with steer torque. This design was only
partially finished, so the merits of it were never tested.</p>

<div class="section" id="orientations-rates-and-accelerations">
<h2>Orientations, Rates and Accelerations<a class="headerlink" href="#orientations-rates-and-accelerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The two most important states that describe the lateral dynamics of the bicycle
are roll and steer (as defined in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="eom.html#eom"><em>Bicycle Equations Of Motion</em></a>). Ideally one would like
to measure the angular orientation, angular rate and angular accelerations of
both the rear frame and the front frame. Sensors that allow direct, independent
and accurate measurements of each are ideal, to avoid having to estimate
measurements through differentiation, integration or state estimators.  The two
bodies share many of the kinematic measurements due to them being connected by
a revolute joint. Table <a class="reference internal" href="#tabkinematicsensors"><em>Table of maximal measured values found in all experimental data

<p>The yaw, roll, pitch and steer rates, are typically measured directly with rate
gyros, which have been available for the later half of the 20th century. The
direct measurement of angular accelerations has yet to mature [Ovaska1998], so
numerical differentiation and filtering of the angular rates is often used. The
angular accelerations can also be computed if the acceleration and location of
multiple points are measured with accelerometers. Most all experimental work
with bicycles and motorcycles provide good examples of employing these type of
kinematic sensors.</p>
<div class="section" id="roll">
<h3>Roll<a class="headerlink" href="#roll" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the other hand, the roll angle is typically the most difficult kinematic
measurement due to the fact that both the bicycle translates with respect to
the ground plane and that the ground plane may not be normal to gravity.
Integration of the easier roll rate measurement is an option, but definite
initial conditions and some way to account for the drift due to integration is
required, and not necessarily trivial. Past researchers have measured the roll
angle with a variety of methods from trailers and third wheels to lasers and
rate gyros with complementary state estimators.</p>
<p>[Dohring1953] may have used a trailer to measure roll angle. [Kageyama1959]
and [Fu1965] introduced one of the earliest direct roll angle measurements.
They made use of a third wheel attached to one side of the motorcycle and
measured the angle between the wheel mounting arm and the motorcycle frame.
[Singh1964] also used a third wheel after having little luck with
accelerometers and rate gyros. He obtained decent measurements but abandoned
the wheel because it was too large, dangerous and susceptible to vibration.
[Roland1971] measured roll angle with a potentiometric free gyro with
seemingly good results. Their data was captured with direct write recorders in
a pace car. [Eaton1973c] used a third wheel and a potentiometer to measure
roll angle on a motorcycle, but also had reliability issues. [Zytveld1975]
used a small trailer with two roller skate wheels and potentiometer to measure
the roll angle on this robotic motorbike.</p>
<div class="admonition-todo admonition" id="index-2">
<p class="first admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p class="last">Find out if Dohring uses a roll angle trailer.</p>
</div>
<p>More modern techniques often focus around roll angle estimation. [Boniolo2008],
[Boniolo2009] develop a simple algorithm to remove the low frequency drift and
only require yaw rate, roll rate and speed measurements to get peak roll
estimation errors of 5 degrees, which were larger than we could accept. But
their methods did allow for roll angle estimation on banked curves. Distance
lasers have been used to directly measure the roll angle with respect to the
ground but are particularly expensive [Everste2009]. The roll angle can also
be estimated with a state estimator such as a Kalman filter ([Gustafsson2002],
[Teerhuis2010]). The plant in the Kalman filter can be general 3D motion of a
rigid body or a model of some order and complexity of the bicycle. Constraining
the estimation with the use of a bicycle model as the plant could have
drawbacks when using the resulting angle for model validation but can give
potentially great results otherwise. These types of algorithms are implemented
in many modern sensor packages and we decided to pursue one of these.</p>
<p>There is a class of sensors called Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and/or
Attitude Heading Reference Systems (AHRS) that have recently become very
affordable and small enough to be very appropriate for orientation and rate
estimation due to the advent of MEMs rate gyros, accelerometers, magnetometers
and GPS technologies. An IMU can theoretically be rigidly affixed to each body
of the system to give complete kinematic details of the motion of that body.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Inertial Measurement Units</dt>
<dd>An inertial measurement unit typically measures three components of body
fixed the angular rate of a rigid body and the three dimensional
acceleration of a single point.</dd>
<dt>Attitude Heading Reference System</dt>
<dd>An attitude heading reference system measures what an IMU does but also
often includes earth magnetic field measurements and/or GPS combined with
microprocessor and estimation algorithm to additionally provide orientation
and/or location estimations.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Many of these systems were within our budget range so we scouted various
companies (MemSense, Navionex, MotionNode, MicroPilot, Crossbow, VectorNav, Ch
Robotics, ..) to see what was offered <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id86" id="id17">[2]</a>. We ended up choosing the VN-100
development board from a relatively new company called <cite>VectorNav
&lt;http://www.vectornav.com&gt;</cite> due to price, on board orientation calculations and
the potential ease of collecting data via a typical RS-232 serial interface. My
preferred software tools, Matlab and Python, both had good serial interface
packages. We placed a single VN-100 on the rear frame to measure the angular
orientations and rates along with the acceleration of a point on the rear
frame. The VN-100 relies on additional magnetometer readings and an on-board
proprietary algorithm based on a Kalman filter for computing the real time
orientation about the three axes.</p>
<p>The VN-100 turned out to be a poor choice for our application in multiple ways.
The second of which I&#8217;ll talk about in a later section. The first is that the
orientation estimations were very poor. I wanted <em>at least</em> accurate estimate
of the roll angle of the bicycle. The VN-100 repeatedly did not provide this.
VectorNav worked with me and tried offer various methods of tuning the VN-100
with state covariance weightings for the Kalman filter and also to tune out any
static magnetic fields from the bicycle frame, but with no success. The highly
likely issues were associated with both the wheel and front frame relative
rotations to the rear frame, with could cause varying disturbances in the
magnetic field. The hub motor also negatively affected the sensor readings and
these may have been too great to tune out. I also realized that going with a
proprietary generic estimator is a bad idea, especially when one has a good
models of the dynamics of the rigid body that the sensor is attached to. In our
case if the Kalman filter was programmable, we could tailor it with the bicycle
model to improve the orientation estimation significantly. Also if the VN-100
could accept input signals, the filter could be tuned well too. After countless
hours trying to tune their proprietary filter I gave up and went with a classic
roll angle measurement design that I should have done in the beginning.</p>
<p>I designed a simple trailer, Figure <em class="xref std std-ref">figRollTrailer</em>, that was pulled
behind the bicycle to measure roll angle with a potentiometer, much in the way
the steer angle was measured.  The trailer needed to be light such that it
didn&#8217;t adversely affect the lateral dynamics and be able to give a good
estimate of the roll angle. All of our experiments were to be on smooth
surfaces, so the vibration issues that on-road tests have seen were of little
concern. I designed the trailer around two caster style polyurethane wheels
(roller blade wheels). They were attached to a frame which attached via a
revolute joint aligned with the roll axis to a yoke that attached at the axle
of the rear wheel.</p>

<p>The potentiometer effectively measures the angle between the yoke and the main
trailer frame <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id87" id="id18">[3]</a>. For a direct measurement of the true roll angle of the bicycle,
the trailer roll axis must lie in the ground plane, but this is physically
impossible so it is preferable for the axis to be as close to the ground as
possible. Figure <em class="xref std std-ref">figTrailerAngle</em> shows how the yoke pitch angle and the
trailer roll angle change as a function of the bicycle roll angle for various
heights above the ground. Notice that the trailer roll angle is virtually
identical to the bicycle roll angle for given heights.</p>

<h3>Steer<a class="headerlink" href="#steer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The steer angle is easy to measure with either some form of write recorder,
potentiometer or encoder and has been accurately measured on many bicycle and
motorcycle systems since the early 50&#8217;s (e.g. [Dohring1953]). Because the
front frame is attached to the rear frame via a revolute joint only an
additional single orientation and rate measurement is needed to measure the
front frame motion. I used a similar design and setup as the Delft instrumented
bicycle: a potentiometer for relative steering angle measurement and a single
axis rate gyro for the body fixed angular rate of the front frame about the
steer axis <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id88" id="id20">[4]</a>. I modified the design with some minor improvements such as better
tension adjustability and switching to a screw mount potentiometer.</p>

<p>As have been shown in previous chapters, the bicycle dynamics are highly
dependent on the speed of the bicycle. This requires good estimations of the
average speed for each constant speed run. I measured the rear wheel rate in
the same fashion as the Delft instrumented bicycle. We mounted a small DC
permanent magnet motor (Globe Motors E-2120 without the encoder) to the rear
frame in much the same way as a simple friction generator for a bicycle light.
A small knurled aluminum disc on the motor shaft engaged the sidewall of the
tire which is radius <span class="math">\(r_c\)</span> from the wheel hub. <span class="math">\(r_c\)</span> was slightly
different for runs 0 to 226 than for run numbers greater than 226 because it

<h2>Kinetics<a class="headerlink" href="#kinetics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A human is able to use a multitude of contact forces and body movements to
control the bicycle. The forces applied by the rider&#8217;s hands to the handlebars
are the most obvious and most effective method of controlling the bicycle <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id89" id="id21">[5]</a>.
But the rider also can impart forces through the seat and the foot pegs. If the
rider is controlling the bicycle without touching the handlebar, these would be
the only locations of rider to bicycle contact. For a complete dynamic picture
of the rider&#8217;s control inputs, all of the essential forces and moments at the
rider/bicycle interface&#8217;s need be measured. In the case of the rigidified
rider, the steering torque is sufficient for characterizing the control inputs.</p>
<p>For the sake of perturbing the closed loop bicycle/rider system, we also needed
to measure and externally applied force or torque, opting for a simple lateral
force perturbation.</p>
<div class="section" id="lateral-perturbation-force">
<h3>Lateral Perturbation Force<a class="headerlink" href="#lateral-perturbation-force" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I was introduced to the idea of external lateral force perturbations from some
of my first email exchanges with Arend and when I was in Delft we did several
experiments with lateral perturbations [Kooijman2009a]. We applied the pulisve
type of perturbations without measuring the applied force assuming they could
be modeled as impulses. [Roland1971] on the other hand attached a calibrated
rocket to the handelbars of a riderless bicycle to give a know step input to
steer torque. [Eaton1973c] had the motorcycle rider tap the handlebars to
applied an impulse and also drop weights from the side of the motorcycle to
apply a roll torque. [Doria2011] similarly had the motorcycle rider apply
impulsive forces to the handlebars to excite the weave mode. [Lange2011]
discusses several methods of applying a pure roll torque to the bicycle
including a mass swing, a mass slider, a rope, and lateral accelerating the
ground. His designs are intended to apply an oscillatory roll torque to
facilitate system identification in the frequency domain <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id93" id="id27">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t able to come up with a clever way of perturbing the system with a
harmonic input and frankly I did not think a great deal about the perturbation
methods, so I simply attached a 100 lb force load cell (Interface SSM-100)
inline with a rope attached to the underside of the bicycle seat. We intended
to apply impulsive lateral forces to the bicycle rear frame. This worked
for the first round of experiments, but only provided a negative lateral force
as it could only be pulled. After the first experiment attempts, we solved this
by attaching the load cell inline with a push/pull stick which was attached to
the seat via a ball joint. The ball joint prevented any external moments from
being applied to the bicycle in a mostly lateral direction.</p>

<div class="legend">
The lateral force stick attached to the underside of the seat. A rod end was
used at the connection to prevent moments from being applied to the rear
frame.</div>
</div>
<p>We were also concerned with the rider predicting the lateral perturbations.
Ideally the rider shouldn&#8217;t be able to predict when or the direction of the
upcoming perturbation. The rider wore a helmet with a blinder on the side of
the lateral force stick so that they could not see the movements of the stick
or the person operating the stick. And secondly, we wrote a simple program
which randomly instructed the perturber when and which direction to apply the
force for the treadmill experiments. During the runs in the gymnasium, we
retained the blinder and provided the perturber with a series of random
push/pull sequences before each run. The operator applied as many perturbations
as possible over the length of the track, which didn&#8217;t give much
unpredictability in the time of perturbation.</p>

<h3>Seat Post<a class="headerlink" href="#seat-post" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As already mentioned, I had intended to measure the forces at all of the
rider/bicycle interfaces. Cal Stone [Stone1990] developed a seat post which
was capable of measuring five components of force in the seat post with an
array of strain gauges. I was going to add a strain gage bridge for the
remaining unmeasured component, torque about the seat axis, to complete the
force measurements and use the seat post in combination with the flexible rider
harness. The seatpost was originally instrumented by simply gluing strain gage
bridges onto a stock seatpost and carefully calibrating the sensor for a
variety of loading combinations. The accuracy of the seat post force
measurements was not all that high due to the small strains seen along the
outer wall of the seat post. In a way, the use of the seatpost was more because
of the convenience of having access to it than obtaining the actual kinetics
involved when using the flexible rider harness. Gilbert and I spent an awful
lot of time figuring out how to use and calibrate the seatpost and associated
equipment. Fortunately, a copy of Cal&#8217;s research notes were found that help
decipher most of the work. We even got in touch with Cal and he provided
additional information. But as time constraints weighed in, we had to abandon
the effort.</p>

easier detachment. Each foot peg was fit with two strain gage bridges to

abandoned due to time constraints.</p>

<h3>Steer Torque<a class="headerlink" href="#steer-torque" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A rider applies forces to the handlebars that cause the front frame to rotate
relative to the bicycle frame. These forces can be lumped into an effective
steer torque. Steer torque is the most effective natural input to controlling a
bicycle and the input that the human most often utilizes. [Roland1972]
explicitly differentiates steer torque based control than steer angle as
opposed to [Lunteren1969] which hypothesized that steer angle was the
controlled input. [Weir1972] demonstrates that steer angle control input has
poor gain and phase margins as compared to steer torque control input.
[Weir1979a] shows that a no hand lane change is much less &#8220;precise and
efficient&#8221; as steer torque control. [Sharp2008a] shows that steer torque is
always the optimal control input when the cost function is based on control
power. Accurately measuring the applied steer torque can provide rich data with
which to understand the bicycle dynamics and the validity of the underlying
models. But steer torque is one of the more difficult variables to properly
measure. The required steering torque for controlling a bicycle in normal
maneuvers is a relatively low magnitude, &lt; 5 Nm. This small torque can be
hidden by the other potentially large forces a rider may apply to the bicycle&#8217;s
handlebars. These small torque magnitudes require a well designed load cell to
give accurate measurements.</p>
<p>There are very few published studies that measure or attempt to measure steer
torque on a bicycle or lightweight single track vehicles and these measurements
typically do not match the results of the analytical models. There have been
more attempts at measuring the steer torque on motorcycles.</p>

<h4>Bicycle Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#bicycle-experiments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>[Lorenzo1997]</dt>
<dd>David de Lorenzo instrumented a bicycle which could measure pedal,
handlebar, and hub forces to characterize the in-plane structural loads
during downhill mountain biking. The handlebar forces were measured with a
handlebar sensitive to <span class="math">\(x\)</span> (pointing forward and parallel to the
ground) and <span class="math">\(z\)</span> (pointing upwards, perpendicular to the ground) axis
forces on both the left and right sides of the handlebar. Net torque about
any vector in the fork plane of symmetry can be calculated from the applied
forces. Figure 3d shows a single plot of steering torque with maximums
around 7 Nm. The stem extension torque (representing the torque from pushing
down and up on the handlebars) reaches 15 Nm, which is about twice the
maximum steer torque shown. The calibration details leads me to believe
that the crosstalk from the all of the forces and moments on the handlebars
gives a very low accuracy for the reported torques, probably in the
<span class="math">\(\pm 1\)</span> to 3 Nm range.</dd>
<dt>[Jackson1998]</dt>
<dd>They don&#8217;t measure steer torque explicitly but attempt to predict the
contributions to the torques acting on the front frame based on orientation,
rate and acceleration data taken while riding a bicycle with no-hands. They
show a single graph with torques under <span class="math">\(\pm2.5\)</span> Nm acting on the front
frame about the steer axis..</dd>
<dt>[Cheng2003]</dt>
<dd>This is a report about a design project at UCSB to develop and implement a
steer torque measurement device on a bicycle. The experiments and
measurements seem to be one of a kind for bicycles at that time. They begin
with doing some basic experiments by attaching a torque wrench to a bicycle
and made left at right turns at speeds from 0 to 13 m/s (0 to 30mph). The
torques were found to be under 5 Nm except for the 13 m/s trial which read
about 20 Nm.  They designed a pretty nice compact torque measurement setup
by mounting the handlebars on bearings and using a linear force transducer
to connect the handlebars to the steer tube, Figure <em class="xref std std-ref">figCheng</em>, which
reduced the effects of other moments and forces acting on the steer tube. It
seems that downward forces applied to the handlebars could possibly still be
transmitted to the load cell. The design does allow one to choose the lever
arm for the load cell, thus giving some choice to amplify the force signal.
They set it up to measure from 0 to 84 Nm with a Model SM Series S-type load
cell from Interface with a 670 Newton range. This range is quite large with
respect to the torque values found in the first experiments. They self
calibrated the sensor with with a set of pulleys and cables to apply a pure
torque to the handlebars. They measured the torque during two different
maneuver types: a sharp turn at various angles and steady turns on various
diameter circles both at 10mph (4.5 meters/second). The rider maintained
constant speed through visual feedback of a speedometer. The signals were
very noisy and he filters the data a moving average. He was not able to
identify any countersteering. He claims the rider turns the handle bars
right to initiate a right turn, which is counter to what models predict. For
the sharp turns the highest reported torque is about 10 Nm, for the steady
turning he reports the highest average torque as 1 Nm.</dd>

<dd>They construct a bicycle with a steer motor and controller which treats the
rider&#8217;s additional input as an additive input instead of a disturbance. The
rider&#8217;s steer torque contribution is estimated from the motor torque and the
handlebar and motor moments of inertia. Little detail is given to properly
assess the design, but measuring steer torque by motor current may be
effective. They are one of the few studies that takes into account some of
the inertial effects of the handlebar.</dd>
<dt>[Cain2010]</dt>
<dd>He designed a custom torque sensor that fit inside a bicycle steer tube. He
mostly removed the crosstalk effects due to an axial load on the sensor, but
the design still seems very likely susceptible to bending moments on the
steer tube. He also didn&#8217;t account for the dynamic inertial affects of the
handlebar and fork/wheel which are above and below the sensor, but this is
most likely inconsequential for steady turns. His measured steer torques for
steady turns never exceeded a magnitude of 2.4 Nm. He wasn&#8217;t able to predict
steer torque well with his bicycle model and only points to the fact that
the sensor was 90% oversized for an explanation.</dd>

<dd>Designs a steer torque sensor for a bicycle which has a range of about
<span class="math">\(\pm7.5\)</span> Nm. He was acutely aware of crosstalk issues with respect to
the other forces applied to the handlebars and tried to design accordingly,
but found that his design was still very susceptible to handlebar loads. He
modifies the device to eventually get more reliable readings. He also didn&#8217;t
account for the inertial effects of the front frame. He had test subjects
ride the bicycle around town so the data is difficult to interpret.</dd>

<p>Steering torque has been measured in relatively few instances of bicycle
experiments and not all that many more for motorcycles. Of these, very few
prove that their design measures a pure rider applied steer torque. This is
more consequential for bicycles than motorcycles because the small torques used
in typical bicycle control are certainly less than 10 Nm with the majority less
than 5 Nm. [Ouden2011], in particular, showed how sensitive the torque
measurements are to other handlebar loads. Also, most of these designs measure
the torque somewhere in between the rider hands and the ground contact point.
This is a physically ideal way to measure the steer torque, but no one has
accounted for the dynamic inertial effects of the front frame above or below
the sensor.  [Everste2010] may be the only design which mitigates this issue.
I&#8217;ll show later in this chapter that for maneuvers that require large steer
angular accelerations, that this is a significant additive effect.</p>
<p>With these previous works in mind, I wanted to develop a very accurate steer
torque measurement system for our bicycle. If one is interested in extracting
the &#8220;pure torque&#8221; applied by the rider to control the bicycle for model
validation purposes, it is critical to take care of several important details.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is the differences in magnitudes of steer torques in the
bicycle models as compared to the bicycle experiments. The steer torque used to
control the various models presented are much lower than the measured values.
This implies that there may be some missing components of torque in the models,
especially with respect to tire interactions with the ground.</p>
<p>I started by taking some crude steer torque measurements myself, similar to the
first method presented by [Cheng2003], as I hadn&#8217;t found Cheng&#8217;s paper or any
of the post 2008 references yet. Secondly, I address the issue of the potential
loads acting on the steer tube other than steer torque. Then I present various
design ideas and the final design. And finally, I show the calculations to
account for the inertial effects of the front frame.</p>

<h4>Torque Wrench Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#torque-wrench-experiments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Following in Cheng&#8217;s footsteps, we decided to do some experiments with an
accurate torque wrench to get an idea of the maximum torques we would see in
our experiments. We designed a simple attachment to the steer tube that allowed
easy connection of various torque wrenches, Figure <em class="xref std std-ref">figTorqueWrenchMount</em>.
A helmet camera was mounted to the bicycle such that it could view the torque
wrench, handlebars and speedometer relative to the bicycle frame, Figure
<em class="xref std std-ref">figTorqueWrenchCamera</em>. The torque wrench (CDI Torque Products 751LDIN)
had a range from 1.7 to 8.5 Nm and a <span class="math">\(\pm 2\%\)</span> accuracy of full scale
(<span class="math">\(\pm 0.17\)</span> Nm) for static measurements, Figure

<p>We recorded video data for two riders performing seven different maneuvers:
straight run into tracking a half circle of radius 6 and 10 meters, tracking a
straight line, 2 meter lane change, slalom with 3 meter spacing, and steady
circle tracking of radius 5 and 10 meters. I viewed the videos and noted down
the maximum and minimum torques for each run. I ignored obviously high torque
readings from accelerations due to riding over bumps.</p>
<p>The single comma separated data file includes the run number that corresponds
to the video number, the rider&#8217;s estimate of the speed after the run in miles
per hour, the maximum reading from the torque needle after the run in inch-lbs,

the maximum torque seen on the video footage in inch-lbs, the minimum torque

<p>This set of experiments enforces the previously cited experimental findings
that steer torques in bicycle control are typically very small. Ideally our
sensor&#8217;s range should be somewhere around <span class="math">\(\pm 8\)</span> to 10 Nm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="forces-on-the-steer-tube">
<h4>Forces on the steer tube<a class="headerlink" href="#forces-on-the-steer-tube" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Measuring the steer torque is not trivial. This is because various models
predict torques ranging in the 0-2 Nm (0-1.5 ft lbs) range with signal
variations and reversals requiring <span class="math">\(\pm 0.01\)</span> Nm (0.01 ft lbs) in
measurement accuracy. The range and accuracy are easily measured with modern
torque sensors, but the fact that large moments can be applied to the fork and
handlebars by the ground and/or rider introduces the problem of crosstalk. The
forces and moments applied to the fork will corrupt the relatively small torque
measurements as they can be hundreds of times larger in magnitude. With this in
mind, we are trying to come up with a way to isolate the torque measurement to
eliminate or minimize the crosstalk and get good, noiseless, accurate readings.</p>
<p>One of the simplest ways to measure steer torque may be to apply a strain gauge
bridge primarily sensitive in torque to the steer tube of the fork. This method
and others would require that the cross sensitivity of the bridge to other loads
in the steer tube to be negligible. For example, [Lorenzo1997] effectively did
this with his handlebar design but used several other bridges to measure
additional moments and forces in handlebar assembly and calibrated the set of
bridges together to help eliminate the crosstalk. The measured steer torques
are less than 10 n-m and the loads due to the applied forces at the wheel
contact, headset bearings and handlebars can potentially be orders of magnitude
greater. [Ouden2011] clearly experienced the difficultly in removing the cross
talk from a steer torque sensor and few studies have explicitly addressed this.</p>
<p>Assuming we may want to measure steer torque somewhere between the handlebars
and fork crown, a simple static analysis can be performed to gage the relative
magnitudes of loads in the steer tube. The bicycle steer tube has various other
forces acting on it. For the most basic case, a the ground contact force at the
front wheel puts the fork into bending and compression. Likewise the person can
apply forces to the handlbars which also put the steer tube into bending and
compression. Figure <em class="xref std std-ref">figBicycleForces</em> shows the free body diagram for a
bicycle statically loaded.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="_images/bicycle-forces.svg" /><p class="caption">figBicycleForces</p>
<div class="legend">
The free body diagram allows for an external steering torque, independent
downward forces on each handlebar, the ground reaction forces and a force
acting on the mass of the bicycle and rider due to vertical acceleration.
The vertical acceleration is simply due to gravity when static, but can be
thought of as a multiple of gravity for dynamic purposes.</div>
</div>
<p>The forces and moments acting on the fork can be isolated algebrically and the
fork modeled as a basic beam supported by the headset bearings (points C and D)
and the forces/moments due to the ground reaction force and force applied to
the handlebars were calculated and applied to points A and B.</p>
<div class="figure">

<div class="legend">
The free body diagram of the fork under the loads shown in Figure
<em class="xref std std-ref">figBicycleForces</em>. The headset bearings at C and D are assumed to not

</div>
<p>The following graph shows what the shear and bending moment diagrams for a 2g
vertical acceleration and ~200 N force on one handlebar grip look like both
from the side and the front of the bike.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/fork-load-diagram.png" src="_images/fork-load-diagram.png" style="width: 5in;" />
<p class="caption">figForkLoad</p>
<div class="legend">
The shear and bending diagrams of the fork under a 2g acceleration and a
right side handlebar load.</div>
</div>
<p>This graph shows that the bending moments and shear stresses can be of much
larger magnitude than the steer torques. Misalignment of strain gages and the
resulting sensor crosstalk are magnified by the differences in loads and need to be
carefully accounted for. If the cross talk strains due to the bending moments
are even 1% of the of the total strain due to the moments, that can still
corrupt the steer torque measurement.</p>
<p>This analisys also predicts that it if no loads are placed on the handlebars
the entire portion of the steer tube/stem above the headset has no bending
moments and no shear stress. This could be the ideal place for a torque sensor,
if one can eliminate the transfer of forces applied to the handlebars to the
steer tube.</p>
<p>This lead me through several design ideas but utlimately to a design that
isolates the steer torque sensor from the handlebar and fork loads with a zero
backlash telescoping double universal joint. The idea solidified after thinking
about an upside down tall bike I had created several years before. This
bicycle&#8217;s tall handlebar, to reach the high rider, was attached to the bicycle
stem at the headset by a horizontal revolute joint which prevented the rider
from applying a fore/aft moment to the handlebar extension, but the rider could
still apply steer torques. My design exploited this odd feature by using a
universal joint which could only transmit a torque about it&#8217;s primary axis. The
telescoping degree of freedom was added after Gilbert helped me realize it was
needed.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/steer-torque-design.png" src="_images/steer-torque-design.png" style="width: 5in;" />
<p class="caption">figSteerTorqueDesign</p>
<div class="legend">
The final steer torque design. The steer torque sensor is mounted atop the
universal joint such that the only load component which can be transferred
through the sensor is an axial torque.</div>
</div>
<p>I attached the universal joint to a Futek 150 in-lb (<span class="math">\(\pm 17\)</span> Nm) TFF350
torque sensor for accurate torque measurements. The torque sensor overloads at
150% of the rated output (i.e. 22.5 Nm), so some care was needed to protect the
sensor from overload and to prevent the rider from losing steer control if the
sensor were to break. I sourced out a &#8220;slip&#8221; clutch that was distributed by
<cite>&lt;http://www.sdp-si.com Stock Drive Products</cite>. It turned out that the device
was a the Torq-Tender manufactured by <cite>Zero-Max Inc.
&lt;http://www.zero-max.com</cite>, but as usual practice SDP doesn&#8217;t readily provide that
information. This particular expensive torque overload protection turned into
a major headache. SDP lists the rated torques but with no indication of the
operating speed the torques are measured at. It turns out they are with respect
to an 1800 rpm operating speed. Being that my rates were rather low, I
purchased a much larger torque sensor than I needed. It was rather painful
trying to get them to change the springs around the Christmas holidays and
check the torque rating at zero rotational speed. The second issue had to do
with it not actually being a slip clutch. I wanted the torque protection to
slip at a given torque (just under overload of the sensor).  The friction based
slipping would still allow the rider to control the bicycle, but SDP mistakenly
called them &#8220;slip clutches&#8221; when in fact they are more like binary torque
limiters and transfer little to no torque after the limit is reached, so the
rider would most likely crash if the torque limiter broke loose. Thirdly, there
was slop in the torque limiter.  I used shim material to take up much of the
slop, but there remained some backlash. I ultimately locked the slip clutch and
relied on careful attendance of the bicycle and the fact that the rider was
unlikely to ever apply greater than 22.5 Nm of torque. The runs 0-226 may have
some slight slop in the torque limiter and runs greater than 226 the limiter
was locked.</p>

<h4>Steer Dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#steer-dynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The final design was setup to exclusively measure the torque in the steer tube
along the steer axis, but this measured torque, <span class="math">\(T_M\)</span>, does not equate to
the input torque used for out bicycle models, (i.e. <span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span>). The
steer torque in the model is defined as the torque between the front frame and
the rear frame about the steer axis. If the torque sensor measures the steering
torque anywhere but at the interface of the human&#8217;s hands and the front frame,
one must account for the inertial effects of the front frame. As far as I can
tell, no one who has measured steer torque on a single track vehicle has
accounted for these effects. There is a relationship from <span class="math">\(T_M\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span> that requires one to know, at a minimum <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id94" id="id74">[7]</a> the friction in
the steer axis bearings above the torque sensor (this is potentially both
viscous and coulomb) and the inertial characteristics of the front frame above
the torque sensor.</p>
<p>In our case, we measured the torque in the steering column, <span class="math">\(T_M\)</span>, from a
sensor that is mounted between the handlebars and the fork. The sensor was also
mounted between two sets of bearings: the headset and the slip clutch bearings.
We are interested in knowing the torque applied about the steer axis by the
rider&#8217;s contact forces to the handlebars, <span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>A free body diagram can be drawn of the upper portion of the handlebar/fork
assembly, where the lower portion is cut at the steer torque sensor, Figure
<em class="xref std std-ref">figHandlebarFreeBody</em>. The torques acting on the handlebar about the
steer axis are the measured torque, <span class="math">\(T_M\)</span>, the rider applied steer
torque, <span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span>, and the friction from the upper bearing set,
<span class="math">\(T_U\)</span>, which can be described by coulomb, <span class="math">\(T_{U_F}\)</span>, and viscous

<p>This configuration allowed us to apply small perturbations to the handlebars

torque. For the first set of trials the sensors were mounted as they normally
are, with the steer angle and rate measurements taken just above the headset

estimated by suspending an 11.4 kg mass from one of the spring and letting it
oscillate while measuring its vertical acceleration via an accelerometer. A
grey box identification routine was used to estimate the spring stiffness for
three trials. We found the average spring stiffness to be <span class="math">\(904.7 \pm 0.6\)</span>
N/m. The inertia of the handlebar, fork and front wheel about the steer axis,
<span class="math">\(I_{HF}\)</span>, was computed based on the measurements described in Chapter

<p>To calculate the applied steer torque, <span class="math">\(T_\delta\)</span>, we need an estimate of
the upper bearing friction, <span class="math">\(T_U\)</span>. A simple assumption is that the
friction in the upper bearings equals the friction in the lower bearings,
<span class="math">\(T_U = T_B / 2\)</span>, but for some of the trials we measured the torque
between the bearings, the steer angle just above the lower bearings and the
steer rate above the upper bearings. This information allows the estimation of
the upper and lower bearing friction independently. The equations of motion of
the assembly above the torque sensor are</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqUpperBearingEOM">

<p>The friction coefficients of the upper bearings can be estimated by treating
the measured torque as an input and the measured steer rate as the output in a
non-linear grey box formulation. The moment of inertia of the handlebars about
the steer axis, i.e. the portion above the torque sensor, <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> is
computed from the physical parameters measurement and is <span class="math">\(0.0656 \pm

<p>Assuming <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(l\)</span> as fixed parameters gave poor
fits (around 50% of the data variability was accounted for by the model), and
thus most likely poor estimates of the friction coefficients. The viscous
coefficient was found to be <span class="math">\(c_U = 0.6 \pm 0.1\)</span> and the Coulomb friction
as <span class="math">\(t_U = 4.0E-8 \pm 7E-8\)</span>. These results are questionable. From the
previous excellent estimates of <span class="math">\(I_{HF}\)</span>, I would have not expected our
<span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> number to be a poor estimate, but this leaves either our
precomputed value of <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> or the measure torque <span class="math">\(T_m\)</span> as the most
likely candidates to being incorrect. If <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> is a free parameter in the
identification the data fits well, but <span class="math">\(I_G\)</span> is different than what was
found with other techniques, <span class="math">\(I_G = 0.0955 \pm 0.0005\)</span>. The fits for the
7 trials rose to over 87% and the viscous friction was <span class="math">\(c_U = 0.38 \pm
0.06\)</span> and the Coulomb <span class="math">\(t_U = 0.08 \pm 0.06\)</span>. The same can be done to
compute the lower bearing friction, but my fits were very poor. The results of
finding the upper bearing and lower bearing friction are inconclusive. So the
assumption that the upper friction is half of the total friction is used to
compute the actual steer torque.</p>

to a level measurable by the NI USB-6218 which had a maximum input range of
<span class="math">\(\pm 10\)</span> volts at 16 bit. I purchased the Futek CSG-110 strain gage

developed a custom amplifier for his seatpost and handlebars which could
amplify up to fourteen bridge signals.  Because I was intending to make use of
the seat post, the amplifier box was used for all the other strain gages. I did
not make use of the seat post and foot pegs, so the amplifier was only used
for the lateral force load cell. I used the amplifier box as was except for
changing the first stage analog amplifier resistor to 16.5k ohm for a
<span class="math">\(\pm100\)</span> lbs range of the lateral force load cell. Cal Stone&#8217;s thesis,

<h3>Software<a class="headerlink" href="#software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I wrote a simple program that collects the data for the self calibrations and
generates a generic calibration file for the various sensors. The data for the
manufacturer supplied calibration data was manually entered to create similar
data files. These files are parsed to and collected into a calibration table

calibration for a particular run is with respect to the date up to and nearest

<p>Both the VectorNav VN-100 and the NI USB-6218 were connected to a small ASUS

interacted with the VN-100 with Matlab&#8217;s Serial I/O toolbox and the NI USB-6218

metadata before each run, arm the system and view the raw data signals after
the run. The general features are as follows:</p>

<li>Automatically increments run numbers</li>
<li>Set metadata: rider, environment, speed, maneuver, notes</li>
<li>Initializes the system</li>
<li>View raw data time history traces</li>

<p>Due to the time synchronization issue talked about below we were limited to a
single trigger setup, versus a multiple trigger for repeated runs. (i.e. we had
to stop after every run to re-initialize the devices, versus allowing the
rider to trigger a series of runs in a row without having to stop).</p>
<p>The source code for the software is available in a Github repository:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleDAQ">https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleDAQ</a>, including some tools for initial post
processing of the collected data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-synchronization">
<h3>Time Synchronization<a class="headerlink" href="#time-synchronization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When we originally chose to use the VectorNav VN-100 and the NI USB-6218 with a
netbook PC, we&#8217;d convinced ourselves that they would all work together
seamlessly. The manufacturers of each device seemed to think so and their
disconnected knowledge helped convince us too. This turned out to be very wrong.
The main issue, which seems to rear its head often in data acquisition, is time
synchronization of all the hardware involved. A PC running a vanilla operating
system is not capable of detailed time management of processes. This is
certainly true of collecting serial data from two independent devices. My
intention was to collect data from both the VN-100 and the USB-6218
simultaneously with the Matlab Serial I/O and Data acquisition toolboxes,
hopefully triggering the initial collection of data from the two devices
simultaneously or by reading the VN-100 serial data through the USB-6218.</p>
<p>The simultaneous triggering was hampered primarily by the VN-100&#8217;s asynchronous
data transfer and no apparent ways to either start it with a trigger or by
recording some signal from it through the USB-6218. It may be possible to read
serial data through the USB-6218, but I did not figure it out. It very well may
have been missing the features to do so, or that Matlab didn&#8217;t have a robust
enough interaction with the USB-6218 to do so. I struggled quite a bit with
this unforeseen issue and we started looking at solutions to measure the same
event with both the VN-100 and the USB-6218 and to synchronize the signals
afterwards. [Ouden2011] had to use a similar technique. We would need to
select a sensor which was also on the VN-100 and then excite the two sensors
with the same event. Ideally this event would be a step input to both sensors.
We tried rate gyros and accelerometers but couldn&#8217;t come up with an adequate
event, until we mentioned the problem to Ron and he immediately suggested just
riding over a bump! This was the ticket.  We ended up attaching an additional
three axis accelerometer to the VN-100 development board which would read the
same vertical component of acceleration and constructing a bump for the bicycle
to travel over at the being of each run.  This provided us with two signals
which could be synchronized in time.</p>
<div class="section" id="bump">
<h4>Bump<a class="headerlink" href="#bump" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The accelerometers had a <span class="math">\(\pm 3\)</span> g range, so we needed a bump which would
provide vertical accelerations within that range for speeds from 1 to 7 m/s.
For a sinusoidal shaped bump, the vertical acceleration for a given speed can
easily be computed. The height of a bump as a function of time is</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqBumpHeight">
<span class="eqno">(21)</span>\[y(t) = \frac{h}{2}\left[1 - \operatorname{cos}\left(\frac{2 \pi v}{L}t\right)\right]\]</div>
<p>where the maximum bump height is <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is the forward speed and
<span class="math">\(L\)</span> is the length of the bump. The acceleration</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{d y(t)}{dt} = 2 h \left(\frac{\pi v}{L}\right)^2
\operatorname{cos}\left( \frac{2 \pi v}{L} t \right)\]</div>
<p>Being that the cosine varies from -1 to 1, the maximum acceleration due to the
bump and acceleration due to gravity is</p>
<div class="math">
\[a = 2 h \left(\frac{\pi v}{L}\right)^2 + g\]</div>
<p>The maximum height of a 1 meter long bump and forward speed of 7 m/s to give
a 3 g acceleration is</p>
<div class="math">
\[h = \frac{a - g}{2}\left(\frac{L}{\pi v}\right)^2 =
\frac{3 * 9.81 \textrm{m/s} - 9.81 \textrm{m/s}}{2}
\left(\frac{1 \textrm{m}}{\pi 7 \textrm{m/s}}\right)^2 = 0.020 m\]</div>

</div>
<p>I fashioned a very low sinusoidal bump from would that we laid on the track on
the floor at the beginning of the track and also launched under the bicycle on
the treadmill. The bump launching is somewhat amusing and we had to construct a
&#8220;bump catcher&#8221; so that the bump didn&#8217;t fly off the back of the treadmill and
hurt anyone or anything.</p>

<h3>Signal Synchronization<a class="headerlink" href="#signal-synchronization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The bump provides the event and the acceleration output of the tandem
accelerometers logs the event. The time shift between the two signals can be
computed by minimizing the least squares with respect to on signal minus the
other signal which has been interpolated at the sample times of the first
signal.</p>
<div class="figure" id="figunsync">
<img alt="_images/unsync.png" src="_images/unsync.png" style="width: 4in;" />
<p class="caption">figUnsync</p>
<div class="legend">
This plot shows the accelerometer signals collected by both the NI USB-6218
and the VN-100 for a typical run. The spikes in acceleration are due to the
bicycle traversing the bump. The NI signal starts about a third of a second
before the VN signal.</div>
</div>
<p>The basic algorithm for computing the error between the two signals is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Shift the NI signal some time tau.</li>
<li>Truncate both signals around the common data.</li>
<li>Interpolate the NI signal at the VN time samples.</li>
<li>Compute the sum of squares of the VN signal minus the interpolated NI
signal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using this formulation, you can then minimize the error with respect to tau.
The minimization requires a good guess, as the minimizing function has local
minima. I use both the location of the max values in the signals and finding
the minimal value of the error as a function of a fixed number of tau values to
get good guesses. See the source code for the gory details.</p>

<h3>Data Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#data-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To handle processing the large amount of data, I developed an object oriented
program, <cite>BicycleDataProcessor
&lt;https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleDataProcessor&gt;</cite>, in Python that interacts
with an HDF5 database containing the data. The program makes use of <cite>PyTables
&lt;http://www.pytables.org&gt;</cite> for database interaction and the
<cite>SciPy/NumPy&lt;http://www.scipy.org&gt;</cite>/<cite>matplotlib&lt;http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net&gt;</cite>
stack for computation and plotting. The program is functional but definitely a
prototype that could leverage other packages to make it more robust. The
structure is currently based on three classes:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Signal</dt>
<dd>This is a subclass of the NumPy ndarray. It tracks a 1 dimensional time
series along with its units. There are basic methods for typical signal
processing such as differentiation, filtering and frequency spectrum.</dd>
<dt>RawSignal</dt>
<dd>The is a subclass of Signal which for the raw signals. This attributes
are populated from the database. In addition to the Signal methods, it has
the ability to scale the signal based on calibration data.</dd>
<dt>Sensor</dt>
<dd>This class contains calibration data for particular sensors and has methods
to extract the correct calibration constants based on calibration date.</dd>
<dt>Run</dt>
<dd>This is the primary class which stores the metadata and signal data for a
specific run. It has methods to process the raw data into  more
meaningful time series that are useful for analyzing the bicycle dynamics.
There are also methods for plotting and exporting the data.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The data collection and initial processing follows this pattern:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Collect data via the BicycleDAQ software. This stores the metadata and
raw signal data for each run in a Matlab mat file.</li>
<li>Convert the mat file to an HDF5 file using Matlab&#8217;s HDF5 utilities. This
step needs to be removed, as SciPy can import the mat files directly. This
is a remnant of learning PyTables.</li>
<li>Build the complete HDF5 database with BicycleDataProcessor.</li>
<li>Load runs from the database and manipulate then for further processing such
as plotting.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach works fairly well and allows for easy querying of the 700+ runs
for further data analysis. The processed data can be exported to Matlab and
generic formats for integration with other software tools. This example gives
the basics of loading a run and plotting the processed data:</p>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter I gave a detailed description of the Davis instrumented bicycle
with the hope that enough information is present for someone to make use of the
bicycle and/or recreate one (of course with improvements). The bicycle served
us well in terms of the kinematic and kinetic data we were interested in
collecting.</p>
<p>Some recommendations for improvements are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Power the entire system from the hub motor battery to reduce the number of
batteries to keep up with.</li>
<li>The steering universal joint needs keyways instead of set screws for a more
solid connection.</li>
<li>Git rid of the VN-100 and replace with two analog rate gyros for yaw and roll. This
would take away the time synchronization issue. The newer versions of the
VN-100 offer more capabilities including synchronization signals, so that could
be looked into, but overall it is still a poor (and expensive) choice for
this application.</li>
<li>Add some gearing to the roll angle measurement for better resolution. And
develop a more accurate calibration scheme. Perhaps by making use of the
on-board accelerometers.</li>
<li>Do away with the torque limiter. Another solution for safeguarding the sensor
and rider in case of failure is needed.</li>
