<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have shown that a basic bicycle model can exhibit stability when linearized
about the nominal configuration for a range of speeds, Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="eom.html#eom"><em>Bicycle Equations Of Motion</em></a>.
Stability is a strong function of the parameters of the bicycle and it turns
out that for standard bicycle designs, they typically exhibit a speed dependent
stability where the bicycle becomes stable at some speed threshold, Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="parameterstudy.html#parameterstudy"><em>Parameter Studies</em></a>. Based on the damping of the weave mode, one may also
even claim that the bicycle becomes  <em>more</em> stable as speed increases,
neglecting the very slow capsize instability. I&#8217;ve also shown that stability
can be enhanced or defeated by extending the Whipple model with a flywheel or
rider degrees of freedom, Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#extensions"><em>Extensions of the Whipple Model</em></a>. In Chapter
<em class="xref std std-ref">motioncapture</em>, I&#8217;ve examined the kinematics of the rider to see if the
rider&#8217;s motion during a control task has any correlation to the kinematics of
the Whipple model and identified the dominant rider motions during
stabilization.</p>
<p>As far as roll stability is concerned, it is highly probable that a human must
enact active control at <em>all</em> times while balancing. I reason this, because
posture control directly affects the bicycle&#8217;s roll angle. But the stability
exhibited of the almost always present weave mode may alleviate the need for
primary roll control provided by the rider. And even if the bicycle-rider
system is open loop unstable at a given speed, the question arises of <em>how</em>
instable is it or <em>how</em> controllable is it. Classic controllability is simply a
binary test to determine whether or not it is possible for a system to be
controlled, whereas there must be some measure variable measure of
controllability that is more relevant to the proposed questions. [Seffen2001]
studies how parameter changes affect controllability, and concludes XXX.
[Schwab2010a] also determines the controllability of several bicycle models
and uses the eigenmode rate magnitude as an example variable measure of the
controllability. The pole locations of an open loop system can also give a
general sense of how easy it can be to control with roots in the far right
plane likely being hard to stabilize.</p>
<p>One can work with different bicycle models (simple/complex [or low/high order]
and linear/non-linear), different control structures and different ways to
identify the optimal numerical values for the controller. For a given order
model most good controllers can place the closed loop poles in the same place
regardless of the control structure. Controllers designed for low order or
linear models are even likely to work with higher order models and non-linear
models.  But depending on the controller structure they can provide more or
less physical insight to the control happening, in particular what a human
might be doing. The human most likely choses robustness over performance.
...Expand this.</p>
<p>The bicycle-rider system presents both a theoretical and experimentally rich
dynamical system for control studies. It is very tractable in the sense that
most people are familiar with controlling a bicycle and that it is a <em>simple</em>
machine which is readily available for experimental use. And thirdly, control
of the bicycle is not necessarily trivial due to it&#8217;s complex dynamics and
provides a platform for testing many strategies. Past control studies tend to
be framed in two different but overlapping frameworks. The first is to simply
control a bicycle (model or real) with any control algorithms and mechanisms
available. Both the simple roll stabilization task and more complex path
tracking tasks have been examined. The results show that bicycles are readily
controllable by a variety of means, from a simple steer in the direction of the
rate of fall to full state feedback with preview of future path variations.
Depending on the sensing and actuation methods chosen these controllers range
in their resemblance to how a human may actually control a bicycle. This leads
into a second framework in which the researcher is explicitly trying to
determine the how a human balances and controls a bicycle.  Basic understanding
of the limited sensory input and actuation available to a human give
constraints on what control structures are adopted. Both frameworks are
motivated by many things such as desire for to implement automatic control,
improving simulation for vehicle design, handling qualities inquiries, control
system testing, etc.</p>
<p>My intention of the work presented in this dissertation falls in the second
framework, where we are most concerned with  identifying the human controller.</p>

<p>Once you dig around in the literature enough you will find many studies on the
control of a bicycle. I&#8217;ve split the review of control models into three
sections. The first are about controllers which have actually be implemented on
robotic bicycles. The second are theoretic controllers that weren&#8217;t
necessarily introduced to identify the human control system and the final
section details efforts that explicitly work with controllers that mimic the
human controller.</p>

<dt>[Zytveld1975]</dt>
<dd>van Zytveld was one of the first to explore the automatic stabilization of the
bicycle that was not explicitly in the human control framework, although he
did chose feedback variables that he believed a human rider could sense. He
attempted to control a robot bicycle with only a leaning rider (inverted
pendulum) through proportional and derivative feedback of rider lean angle
and bicycle roll angle. He made use of a linear model with a rider lean
degree of freedom which was the same as the one presented Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#extensions"><em>Extensions of the Whipple Model</em></a>.  His controller worked on paper, but he wasn&#8217;t able to
ever balance the robot bicycle, with the suspected problems being the
limitations of the hardware he used.</dd>
<dt>[Nagai1983]</dt>
<dd>They constructed a robot bicycle which balanced and tracked itself by
feeding back lateral deviation at a previewed time and the current roll
angle. He was successful at stabilizing his robot. His bicycle model was
much simpler than the Whipple model but he found good agreement between
experiment and the model predictions, with the exception of counter-steer
predictions.</dd>

<dd>They use the same model base as [Iuchi2005] except they now add in a human
torque estimator, so that the controller will not treat the human&#8217;s steer
torque as a disturbance if the controller is activated while a rider is also
trying to control the bicycle. They show some crude experimental results, of
which I assume are of a rider controlling the bicycle with and without the
automatic controller activated. Their human torque accounting is based off
of a estimation of the human torque from the steer motor torque, rather than
explicitly measuring the human&#8217;s torque input.</dd>

remote controlled mini robot bicycle that is similar in nature to the
[Berriah1999] design with remote control. He uses a commercially available
bipedal robot seated on a small bicycle. A gyro detects the systems roll
rate and he uses a PID controller to applied the correct steering for roll
stabilization. The remote control is employed to control the heading.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The limited success of most of the various bicycle robots demonstrates that the
actual implementation of single track vehicle control is not trivial. Some of
the robots could demonstrate basic roll stability and some even capable of path
tracking ability but many didn&#8217;t quite work either. The Murata Boy robot is
quite impressive in its abilities but it uses control outside of what humans
are capable of. The motorcycle robot by Kageyama is probably the most
successful demonstration of a full sized vehicle with control of only steering.
The vehicle dynamic models and control methodologies are varied, implying that
many techniques may be applicable.</p>

<dt>[Sharp2007a]</dt>
<dd>He develops a path tracking controller for the benchmark bicycle
[Meijaard2007] based on full state feedback and optimal control (LQR). He
explores tight to loose control and shows how the gains vary with speed. He
also include a preview model of which the tight control needs 2.5s of
preview and the loose control needs at least 12.5 s. It is interesting to
note that he found little change in computed gains for 20% variations in the
various model parameters, leading him to conclude that the rider would be
robust to various bicycle designs. His controllers show good performance for
randomly generated paths.</dd>
<dt>[Sharp2007]</dt>
<dd>Here Sharp extends his LQR control method with preview from [Sharp2007a] to
the motorcycle with the addition of rider lean torque control. He says that
the objective was to develop a control scheme that <em>somewhat</em> represents a
rider which is simple and effective. His controller inputs are the rider&#8217;s
upper-body absolute and relative lean angles and the path tracking error. He
claims that riders control the motorcycle at the weave frequency at high
speeds. He is able successfully stabilize and track a path and determines
optimal preview gains. He also finds that the rider lean torque control is
relatively ineffective and even with high weighting in the LQR formulation,
the steer torque input dominates the optimal solution.</dd>
<dt>[Sharp2008a]</dt>
<dd>Sharp applies his LQR based preview model control model from [Sharp2007] to
the benchmark bicycle. His findings are somewhat similar. His bicycle model
is 6th order (he includes heading and path deviation) and he sets up the
optimal control problem on full state feedback including varying numbers of
path preview points. The bicycle tracks a path well and he shows high,
medium and low authority control by changing the LQR weightings. In general
the bicycle roll angle and rate gains are the largest, with rider lean gains
following, and steer related gains being the smallest. His leaning rider is
initially stabilized by a passive spring and damper, and he finds that the
lean torque control is minor when paired with steer torque control. Lean
torque alone requires very high gains.</dd>

<dd>Marumo and Nagai design both a PD controller with respect to roll angle and
an LQR controller with full state feedback to stabilize the roll of Sharp&#8217;s
basic motorcycle model through steer torque. The intention is to have a
steer-by-wire system so the rider can specify the desired roll angle with
something like a joystick, thus alleviating the need for the human to learn
to counter steer. They include an additional torque to the controller output
computed from the steady state inverse steer torque to roll angle transfer
function. (this last sentence it weak).</dd>

<h3>Roll Stabilization<a class="headerlink" href="#roll-stabilization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It turns out that the bicycle can be stabilized with simple feedback of roll
angle or roll rate, with the combination of both being working in most cases.
[Mutsaerts2010] in fact demonstrates the simple roll rate feedback
stabilization with a small robotic bicycle. But these are not necessarily good
controllers, and certainly not controllers which mimic the human.  Regardless,
their simplicity allows one to  demonstrate some of the interesting system
dynamics. Take for example Charlie riding on the Rigidcl bicycle at 7 m/s. The
linear Whipple model about the nominal configuration gives the steer torque and
roll torque to roll and steer angle transfer functions as</p>

<p>The denominators of the transfer functions show that we have three stable
modes, as expected. The numerators are potentially more interesting. Note that
the steer torque to steer angle and the roll torque to steer angle transfer
functions both have a single right half plane zero. This single right half
plane zero means that the steer angle response from either input will exhibit
an initial undershoot for a given steer torque input [Hoagg2007]. This
phenomena can be demonstrated by examining the step response of the two
transfer functions is shown in Figure <em class="xref std std-ref">figStableStepResponse</em>.</p>

The upper graph shows the roll and steer angle time histories for a step
response roll torque to the Whipple model linearized about the nomimal

The parameters are taken from the rider Charlie on the Rigicl bicycle and
the speed is 7 m/s which is within the stable speed range.</div>
</div>
<p>As expected we see initial undershoot in the steer angle. In this case, the
initial undershoot is initially departs in the asymptotic direction, but
reverses and settles to a negative steer angle. This is easily demonstrated
while riding a bicycle by placing one&#8217;s flat open palms on the handlbebar
grips.  By applying a torque intending to turn the handlebars in the positive
direction, the handlebars initially go in the correct direction, but once the
frame rolls in the negative direction, the steering angle reverses and puts the
bicycle into a steady turn in the negative direction.</p>
<p>If we examine the change in the transfer function zeros as a function of
forward speed, we see that both the steer angle transfer functions always have
a right half plane zero always have a right half plane zero. And for
<span class="math">\(\frac{\delta}{T_\delta}(s)\)</span>, the zeros do not change with respect to
speed. It is also interesting to note that at low speeds both roll angle
transfer functions eventually develop right half plane zeros. For roll torque,
this would mean that at low speeds a positive roll torque step input (i.e from
a gust of wind) would cause a positive roll angle initial overshoot with the
roll angle settling to a negative value at steady state. I&#8217;ve often felt like I
fall into the wind on my bicycle and this could confirm it at least for low
speeds, but it may be tied more to phenomena associtated with the rider&#8217;s
biomechanical degrees of freedom.</p>

<h4>Counter Steering<a class="headerlink" href="#counter-steering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Countersteering is a confusing topic and people give different definitions.
Motorcycle driving instructors teach their students to steer into the obstacle
that they want to go around.</p>
<p>[Limebeer2006] and [Sharp2008] duly note that the term countersteering is
used for potentially two conflicting ideas. They examine the effects of the
right half plane zero of simplified point mass model in much the same way as
[Astrom2005].  Sharp and Limebeer show that both the steer torque to steer
angle and steer torque to lateral deviation have right half plane zeros and
Astrom develops a <em>steer angle</em> to roll angle transfer function that has a
right half plane zero. The Whipple model matches the [Limebeer2006]
interpretation, i.e. that the right half plane zero is the steer torque to
steer angle transfer function.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p class="last">Quote cossalter 2007 on the second def of coutnersteer</p>
</div>
<p>The first and most common definition of countersteer is</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Steer torque is applied in the opposite direction you want to turn which in
turn causes the steer angle to initially depart in the opposite direction of
the turn, but the steer angle reverses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second definition regards what happens to the steer torque</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The applied steer torque may reverse sign to maintain steady turn. This is
true at high speeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The step response at a stable speed shows that for a given roll angle departure
the natural stability enforces that steer angle must initially depart in the
opposite direction. In the case of roll torque input, a positive roll torque
causes a positive roll angle but an initially negative steer angle. Afterwards
the bicycle settles into a positive steady turn with respect to yaw. For the
steer torque input, a positive steer torque causes an initially positive steer
angle which in turn cause a negative roll angle. The bicycle settles into a
negative steady turn.</p>
<p>[Limebeer2006] note that the required steer torque sign varies with speed, but
to observe that one needs to control the bicycle as other speeds are
potentially outside the stable speed range.</p>
<p>Below the weave critical speed, the bicycle can be stabilized by a simple gain
on roll rate feedback. Note that this gain is negative, giving positive
feedback. This implies to apply steer torque in the same sense as the rate of
fall. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id141" id="id94">[1]</a></p>

</div>
<p>For steer torque control inputs, countersteering amounts to this: To get the
bicycle into a positive turn, one must initially apply a negative steer
torque to cause an initially negative steer angle and a positive roll angle.
The steer angle exhibits initial undershoot due to the right half plane zero
and settles to a positive angle at steady state. This is the case for at least
all speeds above very slow speeds where the steer torque to roll angle transfer
function has a right half plane zero.</p>

primarily interested in identifying the human control system in the bicycle
riding task. Their studies spanned several years in the late 60s and early 70s.
[Lunteren1967], [Lunteren1969], [Lunteren1970], [Lunteren1970a],
[Stassen1973], [Lunteren1973] uses a bicycle roll angle feedback with PID
control that drives the rider&#8217;s lean angle and steer angle. The bicycle model
they employ is is quite simple (it models their simulator more than a real
bicycle) and does not exhibit coupling in steer and roll. The model also has
steer and lean angle input as opposed to input torques. They also mention that
the control structure was chosen because of equipment limitations and cite
recent manual control models [McRuerXXXX] as being probably being preferable.
None-the-less the studies were before their time and quite impressive. They
concluded that roll angle control was more reflexive and that the steer angle
control was more cerebral based on identified time delays. [Lange2011]
develops a more up-to-date model with the same type of structure as van

<p>Weir worked with McRuer on some manual control papers prior to his PhD thesis
[Weir1972], where he employed a crossover model along side a motorcycle model
which is based on Sharp&#8217;s early motorcycle model [Sharp1971] to evaluate the
controller used by humans. This is the most likely the first complete attempt
at analyzing the rider-motorcycle control system. Weir determined that roll
angle feedback combined with a basic human model and a simple gain controlling
steer torque was the most effective control mechanism. In particular, he showed
how steer angle control was poor and he even examined rider lean angle control
using a pseudo rider lean model similar to [Hess2012]. Rider lean could
successfully control the system, but required large lean angles. He also worked
with multiple loop closures and found that roll angle fed back to control steer
torque with heading and lateral deviation fed back to control rider lean angle
presented the best control strategy for the human rider. He only did his
studies at a single high speed with a motorcycle model which only required
stabilization of the capsize mode. It is highly likely that these control
strategies could vary with speed, especially at low speed where the weave mode
is the dominant instability. Weir and Zellner went on to complete several more
important studies involving manual control of the motorcycle [Weir1978],

<p>A recently uncovered study by Doyle ([Doyle1987], [Doyle1988]), thanks to
Google&#8217;s book scanning endeavors and Jim Papadopoulus persistence in searching, presents a
slow speed view for bicycle control in much contrast to the Weir studies, not
only because of the speed and vehicle differences, but because it is from the
view of a psychologist. We engineers are quick to model the human sensory and
actuation system, with little understanding of the intricacies of the human
brain. Doyle&#8217;s treatise gives a refreshing look from outside the engineering
box. Doyle&#8217;s control model is fundamentally a sequential loop closure with the
inner most loop being roll control and the outer two being heading and path
deviation. He says that the outer loops are highly dependent on the inner loop.
For the inner loop he determines that continuously feeding back both roll
acceleration with integral and proportional gains adjusted by the human as the
crossover model dictates will stabilize the bicycle at non intended roll
angles. To control roll angle, he claims that we do not do this in a continuous
but that we apply discrete pulses when the roll angle meets a threshold. This
model has similar form to the one developed by us in the next section.</p>

seems like it may certainly be valuable for conscious control efforts, but may
have deficiencies when trying to determine the control strategy of unconscious
control. But a combination of fuzzy logic and crossover type control may prove
useful in describing the human control system. Liu and Wu have done extensive

happen if the bicycle is unstable in roll. Few people have demonstrated robust
control of a real system which stabilizes in roll at a variety of speeds. Even

<h2>Hess Manual Control Model<a class="headerlink" href="#hess-manual-control-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many control model architectures can be used to attempt to identify the human
control system while riding the bicycle. We are only limited by the type of
sensory information a human rider can sense and the actuation means. The human
operator has been modeled with simple models like the crossover model, to more
complex neuromuscular dynamics and even fuzzy and optimal control. Some of the
controllers are essentially equivalent placing the closed loop poles in the
same place, but make use of different techniques to get to the end result. The
models may also be different in complexity. In general finding the simplest
mathematical model capable of capturing the dynamics one is interested is a
good goal. With this in mind, my advisor Ron Hess developed a controller based
on the Whipple bicycle model and his previous successful human operator models.
We present the control model and the loop closure procedure for selecting the
five model gains in [Hess2012]. This model is fundamentally similar in nature
to Weir&#8217;s work and has the same roots through the work of McRuer. We similarly
found steer angle based control to be troublesome and had success across a
broad range of speeds and selection of bicycles with steer torque control. We
also employed a similar method of evaluating rider lean control with
introducing an extra degree of freedom. It also has semblance to the work of
[Doyle1987] with the inner loop structure dedicated to roll stabilization and
the outer loops to high cognitive control in heading and path tracking.</p>

<h3>Basics of manual control theory<a class="headerlink" href="#basics-of-manual-control-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Manual control, or human operator control, was primarily birthed from control
engineers after world war two. The requirements for machine designs in which
humans were the principal control element, such as artillery guns and aircraft,
led to human control modeling. Theoretical work by [Tustin1947] theorized
early on that a human control systems could be modeled similarly to automatic
feedback systems. This was followed by experimental work by [McRuer1965] mostly
confirming these hypotheses.</p>
<p>It turns out that humans adjust their control such that the combine human and
plant dynamics behave with desirable closed loop dynamics. This phenomena can
be captured by a variety of theoretical control structures from simple
dynamics to complex neuromuscular models [Hess1997]. Fortunately, the simple
models can capture much of the dynamics in systems such our bicycle-rider
system. Here after we make use of the crossover model [McRuer1974]. The reason
for this is multi-fold. It allows us to stick with a simple system which has
been applied to numerous man-machine systems with good results.</p>
<p>compensatory: controller uses the error only to make control
pursuit: both error and input information is available for the controller</p>
<p>The basic idea of the crossover model is that the when the human is paired
with the plant which she is trying to control that the combined open loop
transfer function conforms to the dictates of a sound control system design
around the crossover frequency [Hess1997]. The form of this transfer function
for many control tasks takes the form</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-crossover">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[G_{human}G_{plant}(s) = \frac{\omega_c e^{-\tau_e s}}{s}\]</div>

demonstrated in [Lange2011]; the difficultly level is high without it. The
outer loops are also visual, heading and lateral path deviation, Figure

<p>The control structure is simply a function of five gains, which the human
adjusts under the dictates of the crossover model to get good overall system
performance. The two inner most loop gains are chosen such that all of the
oscillatory roots of the closed loop have at least a 0.15 damping ratio.
Whereas the three outer loop gains are chosen such that the open loop crossover
frequencies are half the previous.</p>
<div class="admonition-todo admonition" id="index-20">
<p class="first admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p class="last">Why do we need the proprioceptive loop?</p>
</div>
<p>Traditionally, sequential loop closure methods are performed on a case by case
basis and involve some subjectiveness in applying the rules of thumb. This is
time consuming and error prone when you have to find the gains for many systems
as in our bicycles and riders at various speeds. We automated the technique
described in [Hess2012] can be automated to alleviate this.</p>
<p>The closed roll angle loop should be stable, as stability in roll is critical
for the path tracking in the outer two loops. To get there, the closure of the
proprioceptive and vestibular loops must push the poles to a favorable spot for
application of the crossover model on the roll angle loop. To do this, the
first two loop closure require that all of the oscillatory modes have a minimum
damping ratio of 0.15. We first use the proprioceptive gain, <span class="math">\(k_\delta\)</span>
to push the poles originating at the bicycle weave eigenvalue to a higher
frequency with 0.15 damping. The closed loop transfer function for the steer
loop is</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqDeltaLoop">
<span class="eqno">(4)</span>\[G_{\delta c} = \frac{\delta}{\delta_c} =
\frac{ G_{\delta o}}{1 + G_{\delta o}}\]\[G_{\delta o}(s) = k_\delta G_{nm} \left(\frac{\delta}{T_\delta}]\right)_b\]</div>
<p>A numerical example of Charlie on the Rigidcl bicycle at 5 m/s gives</p>
<div class="math">
\[G_{\delta o}(s)|_{k_\delta = 1} = \frac{4990.0342 (s+2.934) (s-2.934)}
{(s+17.08) (s+2.56) (s^2 - 1.306s + 5.18) (s^2 + 43.02s + 900)}\]</div>
<p>The characteristic equation is 6th order and the caster, capsize and
nueromuscular modes are all stable and weave model is unstable. The first loop
closure will drive the unstable weave pole out  such that the interaction of
the original nueromuscular poles and weave poles give the new nueromuscular
mode about 0.15 damping at about 10 rad/s natural frequency. This is typical
neuromuscular/machine interaction seen in human operator control.</p>
<p>To set the damping ratio multiple approaches can be take, here I&#8217;ll show a Bode
design and a root locus based design. For the Bode design, this can be enforced
by finding the gain such that the dominant pole has a 10db peak. This dominant
pole is the neuromuscular mode created when combing the neuromuscular model
with the bicycle plant. For this bicycle and speed, a gain of ~45.9 will set
the inner loop as desired.</p>
<div class="figure" id="figdeltabode">

<p class="caption">figDeltaBode</p>
<div class="legend">
The Bode plots of the closed steer loop with various gains. Notice how the
higher gains push the neuromuscular peak to a frequency typical of human
operator and plant dynamics [Hess2012].</div>
</div>
<p>By plotting the damping ratio of the closed loop poles as a function of
<span class="math">\(k_\delta\)</span> the desired gain can also easily be picked off on a root locus
diagram. The bicycle-rider system is similar enough in nature for speeds above
2 m/s that this always works. [Lange2011] reported difficulties stabilizing
his system below about 2 m/s too. We&#8217;ve found that relaxing the 10db peak
requirement such that the neuromuscular mode is more damped, will allow for
successive closure and a stable system for lower speeds. But as we all know,
the bicycle is very difficult for a human to balance at extremely low speeds.
The fast time constants compounded with human neuro processing delays makes
this true. There are even slow bicycle competitions that take advantage of this
fact to test the balancing skill of the rider.</p>

</div>
<p>The root locus of the closed delta loop poles as a function of <span class="math">\(k_\delta\)</span>
gives an idea where we can push the poles for the next loop closure. Notice
that the poles associated with the weave mode at <span class="math">\(k_\delta=0\)</span> are pushed
into the stable regime and back out, crossing the 0.15 damping ratio line
twice. There is a range of gains between about 3.1 and 44.0 which cause all of
the oscillatory modes to have at least 0.15 damping ratio. This is very clear
when plotting the damping ratio versus gain in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#figdeltadamp"><em>figDeltaDamp</em></a>.  The
best choice is typically to set the gain such that the pole is at the highest
frequency allowable with minimum damping, to give typical human operator
behavior. This will set up the bandwith of the sub sequent loops to be high
enough for good system performance.</p>

gains such that all the roots are stable and the damping ratio is at least

<p>With the loop closed the transfer function takes the form</p>
<div class="math">
\[G_{\delta c}(s) = \frac{229042.5688 (s+2.934) (s-2.934)}

<p>Notice the single unstable poll at <span class="math">\(s=2.333\)</span>.</p>
<p>The roll rate loop closure is trickier to set. We want to maintain the 10db
peaking on the neuromuscular mode that we just set, but select a roll rate gain
such that any other new oscillatory mode also have a minimum damping ratio of
0.15, but from Figure <em class="xref std std-ref">figPhiDotDamp</em> we see that we are already in good
shape. Since the bicycle with steer control exhibits non-minimum behavior, we
need to introduce a positive feedback on roll rate. So it turns out that with
a slight negative gain we can maintain the neuromuscular mode behavior but
introduce the require sign change for stability.</p>

the gain such that the crossover frequency of the roll most loop is 2 rad/s

set by measuring the gain of transfer function at the desired crossover

at speeds below 3 m/s there is non-linear variation. These gains give a stable
system which is capable of the lane change manuever, but due to the
difficulties in selecting the gains with rules above the algorthm may be making
poor choices, especially for <span class="math">\(k_\dot{\phi}\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Software<a class="headerlink" href="#software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It generates the state space form of the linear Whipple model for any
parameter sets and speeds. The outputs include all eight of the configuration

addition of the front contact point. This includes the lateral force input
described in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#extensions"><em>Extensions of the Whipple Model</em></a>.</li>
<li>It generates the state space form of the closed loops system as a function
of the bicycle-rider parameters, the speed, the five gains and the
neuromuscular frequency.</li>
<li>It computes the gains with the sequential loop closure guidelines described
above for any give bicycle-rider and speed. (Very low speeds may require some
hand modification.) The open and closed loop transfer functions for each loop
can be returned and or plotted. It can also do this for roll torque as the
input as described in [Hess2012].</li>
<li>It simulates the system performing a single or double lane change with a
given or computed set of gains and plots the results.</li>
<li>It computes the lateral force input transfer functions.</li>
<li>It computes the handling quality metric described in [Hess2012].</li>
<li>It plots the gains versus speed.</li>
