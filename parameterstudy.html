<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Investigation of the effects of changes in the model parameters are natural
place to start once the various bicycle models are available. For the bicycle
designer, understanding how changing the parameters effects the dynamic
characteristics is something of a holy grail. If connections can be drawn from
model parameters to such things as handle-ability, stability, and controllability
bicycle designs could be tuned with these things mind. In the aircraft design
world correlations have been drawn from open loop dynamics to handling
qualities. It is highly likely that open loop dynamics can be predictors of the
handling of a bicycle, but there are large differences in aircraft, ground
vehicles, and bicycles. The most glaring is the size of the rider with respect
to the vehicle and the fact that the rider&#8217;s biomechanics, which are not
trivial contribute to the open loop dynamics of the entire system.</p>
<p>The eigenmodes of the Whipple model and the stability regime are prime targets
for initial parameter studies and there are many papers that deal with various
aspects. An analytical view of the parameter relationships would provide the
most encompassing conclusions, but the complicated form of the equations
typically lead researchers to numerical studies. [Zytveld1975] studies the
effects of trail, front wheel moment of inertia, and rider position on the
dynamics using Routh&#8217;s criteria and a sensitivity study. Jim Papadopoulos
[Kooijman2011] has made great progress analytical studies and also solves for
Routh&#8217;s stability criteria for the capsize mode. [Franke1990] and
[Astrom2005] examine the effect of stable speed range with respect to
independently varying wheel inertia and find that for their parameter sets both
the weave and capsize critical speeds decrease with increase in spin moment of
inertia. [Franke1990] also shows that as trail increases both the critical
speeds and the stable speed range increase. This conclusion is counter
intuitive, as many seem to believe that an increase in trail lowers the weave
critical speed, thus making the bicycle more stable [Kooijman2008].
[Stevens2009] examines experimentally and numerically the effects of the front
end geometry on eigenvalues, with some similar results as [Kooijman2008].
[Tak2010] examines the derivatives of the critical speeds with respect to the
benchmark parameters for a nominal parameter set. Tak&#8217;s method allows one to
quickly visualize the independent parameter change which affects the stable
speed range the most for a given bicycle. Other examples of parameter studies
include [Sharp1971], [Sharp1994], [Cossalter1999], and [Lai2003] among many
others.</p>
<p>Numerical parameters studies were the first thing I did once I had a working
Whipple model [Moore2008] and I&#8217;ve explored some other studies over the years.
The following sections provide some the results and various small findings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="geometric-variation">
<h2>Geometric Variation<a class="headerlink" href="#geometric-variation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>My first curiosities about bicycle handling arose when I was designing the
frame geometry of a recumbent bicycle for my bachelor&#8217;s senior design project
and this geometry based outlook seems to be continually the main interest among
bicycle enthusiasts and designers. Many bicycle designers focus on the geometry
as the primary design criteria for handling, in particular the head tube angle
and trail (or rake), <a class="reference internal" href="#figbicyclegeometry"><em>Figure 1</em></a>. But wheelbase, front
wheel diameter, frame/wheel alignment and even handlebar geometry rider
position are considered too. A browse through bicycle magazines and frame
builder literature provide a wide range of opinions what how geometry affects
the handling. For example, Tim Paterek, an expert frame builder, claims that
the comfort zone for trail falls between 0.05 m and 0.065 m for most bicycles
[Paterek2004]. Craig Calfee is another prominent frame builder interested the
effects of fork alignment on handling and wrote a small piece on bicycle
geometry for the 2007 North American Handbuilt Bicycle show [Calfee2007]. He
points out that minute misalignments in the fork geometry can cause undesirable
handling. Finally, Jan Heine has written extensively in his Vintage Bicycle
Quarterly about handling with subject and objective measures by experienced
riders to the handling differences in real bicycles.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figbicyclegeometry">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/bicycle-geometry.*"><img alt="_images/bicycle-geometry1.png" src="_images/bicycle-geometry1.png" style="width: 3.797in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The essential geometry of a bicycle parameterized with variables typically
of interest to bicycle designers.</p>
</div>
<p>But the reality is that it is difficult to make any conclusive connections to
handling and geometry in a broad sense using rigorous dynamic and control
theory. Little progress has been made on this front. Nonetheless parameter
studies can still be done with the models we have available. The following
results show how the stable speed range of the Whipple model linearized about
the nominal configuration change with respect to independently varying the
essential geometry: trail, head tube angle, wheelbase and front wheel diameter.
Unlike in many other parameter studies, the physical associated with the
rider&#8217;s position and the bicycle&#8217;s parameters other than the essential geometry
are interdependent (i.e. adjusting the front wheel diameter changes the wheel’s
mass and moment of inertia together with the bicycle’s frame geometry and
adjusting the wheelbase causes the rider to reach further forward). The rider
parameters are estimated using a method which was a slight precursor to the
simple geometry method presented in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="physicalparameters.html#physicalparameters"><em>Physical Parameters</em></a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id17">[1]</a> and
where based off of a 72 kg, 182 cm tall adult male. The rear frame and fork
were modelled as a collection of uniform steel tubes and the wheels as simple
tori. This allowed one to estimate the inertial properties of a bicycle as a
function of geometry. It assumed a normal diamond frame bicycle and the base
geometry of the bicycle was measured from a 58 cm 1982 Schwinn LeTour steel
road bike.</p>
<p>The stable speed range for the nominal configuration was between about 3.59 m/s
and 4.88 m/s. Changes in the stable speed range were calculated by varying each
parameter over a realistic range for a bicycle of this nature. Each figure
shows a depiction of the maximal and minimal geometry configurations and the
nominal stable speed range is shown with a vertical line.</p>
<p>At speeds greater than the capsize critical speed, the capsize mode is unstable
with a slow time to double. Thus the instability can be assumed to be
relatively easy to stabilize with a simple control, especially since the weave
mode provides rapid roll damping. That implies that the stable speed range and
capsize critical speed may be of less importance to actual stability, leaving
the weave critical speed as the defining characteristic.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figheadtubeangle">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/head-tube-angle.*"><img alt="_images/head-tube-angle.png" src="_images/head-tube-angle.png" style="width: 3.5in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The change in stable speed range as a function of head tube angle.</p>
</div>
<p>A slack head tube angle (&lt; 72 degrees) has a higher weave critical speed than a
larger head tube angle but the capsize critical speed varies very little with
changing head tube angle, <a class="reference internal" href="#figheadtubeangle"><em>Figure 2</em></a>. Slack head tube
angles are found on many utility bicycles. I&#8217;ve founded that these bicycles
feel very unresponsive at low speeds and typically do not feel stable until
moderate speeds are reached. The head tube angle results are in agreement with
this anecdotal evidence in so far as the weave critical speed increases with
decreasing head tube angle. The head tube angle results are interesting because
the weave speed can be decreased using a steeper head tube angle without
adversely affecting the capsize critical speed, thus simultaneously increasing
the stable speed range and decreasing the weave speed. This is ideal if it is
assumed that a low weave critical speed is beneficial for take off and a broad
stable speed range is beneficial for cruising with little control input.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figtrail">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/trail.png"><img alt="_images/trail.png" src="_images/trail.png" style="width: 3.5in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The change in stable speed range as a function of trail.</p>
</div>
<p>Trail is typically of particular interest, with many bicycle designers claiming
that it is the most important parameter affecting handling qualities. As trail
increases, the stable speed range broadens and the weave critical velocity
increases, <a class="reference internal" href="#figtrail"><em>Figure 3</em></a>. As trail approaches zero the stable
speed range diminishes to zero.  It is obvious that increasing trail will
decrease the caster mode eigenvalue, but unintuitively it increases the weave
eigenvalue. The yellow bicycle and the silver bicycle [Kooijman2006] both have
their forks flipped for increase trail with the intent on the bicycles being
stable at the speeds tested. According to the these results it does not seem as
that is the case, it may have the opposite effect.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figwheelbase">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/wheelbase.png"><img alt="_images/wheelbase.png" src="_images/wheelbase.png" style="width: 3.5in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The change in stable speed range as a function of wheelbase.</p>
</div>
<p>Long bicycles such as tandems and some recumbents are often hard to start and
have slower response. As wheelbase increases the stable speed range stays
constant as both weave and capsize critical speeds increase linearly at the
with the same slope rate, <a class="reference internal" href="#figwheelbase"><em>Figure 4</em></a>. The weave critical
speed increases as wheelbase increases which may correlates with the difficulty
in starting long wheelbase bicycles.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="figfrontwheeldiameter">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/front-wheel-diameter.png"><img alt="_images/front-wheel-diameter.png" src="_images/front-wheel-diameter.png" style="width: 3.5in;" /></a>
<p class="caption">The change in stable speed range as a function of front wheel diameter.</p>
</div>
<p>The weave critical speed decreases as front wheel diameter increases but the
capsize critical speed decreases even faster so the size of the stable speed
envelope also decreases, <a class="reference internal" href="#figfrontwheeldiameter"><em>Figure 5</em></a>. The results
show that the weave critical speed decreases with a larger front wheel which
provides stability at low speeds. This correlates with the findings for the
flywheel bicycle presented in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="extensions.html#extensions"><em>Extensions of the Whipple Model</em></a>.</p>
<p>I have made some conclusions about the stability of the Whipple model and made
some subjective conclusions on the potentially relationship of the critical
speeds with geometry changes. This gives some idea of how one may begin
connecting handling to the bicycle&#8217;s dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bicycle-comparison">
<h2>Bicycle Comparison<a class="headerlink" href="#bicycle-comparison" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I present the physical parameters of ten bicycles in Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="physicalparameters.html#physicalparameters"><em>Physical Parameters</em></a>. There are variety of bicycles from commuter bicycles
to road racing and mountain to a child&#8217;s bicycle and some instrumented
bicycles.  Here I will present some comparisons of the linear dynamics of the
different bicycles and try to make some conclusions about their dynamics. The
&#8220;normal&#8221; diamond frame bicycle is very similar from bicycle to bicycle with
very little variation in the essential geometry. More variation is seen in the
mass and inertia.</p>
<div class="section" id="benchmark-validity">
<h3>Benchmark validity<a class="headerlink" href="#benchmark-validity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The numerical benchmark bicycle parameters in [Meijaard2007] are
representative of a real bicycle but were designed so that each parameter was
guaranteed a detectable role in numerical studies. Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#figbenchmarkreal"><em>Figure 6</em></a> compares the eigenvalues of the benchmark bicycle with
those of two ordinary bicycles, the Batavus Browser and Batavus Stratos
including the rider, Jason, seated on the bicycles. The eigenvalues are
qualitatively similar, but the stable speed range is both lower and narrower.
The weave frequency also diverts from the real bicycles at higher speeds, but
other than that the benchmark parameters are most likely within realistic
bounds for a normal style bicycle.</p>

<div class="section" id="rider-less-bicycles">
<h3>Rider-less bicycles<a class="headerlink" href="#rider-less-bicycles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are relatively few datasets with where real bicycle parameters were
measured as described in Chapter <a class="reference internal" href="physicalparameters.html#physicalparameters"><em>Physical Parameters</em></a>.  <em class="xref std std-ref">Figure 7</em> plots one such parameter set, labeled Silver, from
[Kooijman2008] and compares it to several of the rider-less bicycles I
measured using almost identical techniques. Notice that all of the bicycles I
measured show a bifurcation in the caster and capsize modes at lower speeds
which produces second oscillatory mode not necessarily seen in the parameter
sets with a rigid rider. Figures <a class="reference internal" href="#figcresevecweave"><em>8</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#figcresevecosc"><em>9</em></a> give a look at the eigenvector components for the two
oscillatory modes for the Crescendo bicycle at 1.5 m/s. They turn out to be
similar modes in that they oscillatory in roll and steer, with steer being
dominant in magnitude and the phase shifts slightly larger for the weave mode.
But the new mode is stable as opposed to the weave mode being unstable. The
bicycles measured in [Stevens2009] and [Escalonas2011] both exhibit this
mode, but Steven&#8217;s parameters are estimated from a CAD drawing, which may not
be that accurate. Steven&#8217;s does show that this mode disappears with very steep
or very slack head tube angles. The diagrams for very slack head angles more
qualitatively resemble the Silver bicycle from [Kooijman2008]. But it is still
odd that the Silver bicycle is that different than all the other bicycles, with
the only major difference being a flipped fork for more trail and a larger yaw
and roll moment of inertia due to the outriggers.</p>

<h3>Riders<a class="headerlink" href="#riders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are some potentially significant differences in the Whipple model
dynamics for a riderless bicycle and a bicycle with a rider rider.
<a class="reference internal" href="#figcompareridereig"><em>Figure 10</em></a> gives an example of how the eigenvalues
change when a rider is added to the Stratos bicycle. The stable speed range
broadens and the weave critical speed increases by over 1 m/s. The second
oscillatory mode disappears and the caster mode has higher damping. The weave
bifurcation point occurs at a lower speed. And finally the natural frequency of
the weave mode for the rider and bike is much lower for speeds above 3 m/s. The
changes in dynamics are enough that conclusions made about bicycles without
rigid riders don&#8217;t necessarily extend to bicycles with rigid riders.</p>

<h3>Yellow bicycle<a class="headerlink" href="#yellow-bicycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I measured the parameters of the &#8220;Yellow&#8221; bicycle at TU Delft, which was a
replica of the Yellow bike from Cornell which demonstrates stability so well. I
measured the bicycle in two configurations, one with the fork in the normal
position and the second with the fork flipped 180 degrees about the steer axis
to exaggerate trail. <a class="reference internal" href="#figyellowcompare"><em>Figure 11</em></a> plots the root locus
with respect to speed for the two yellow bicycle configuration and the silver
bicycle which also has a reversed fork. As was mentioned in the previous
section the weave critical speed increases as the trail increases and this is
clearly shown for the yellow bicycle with a reversed fork. But maybe more
interestingly the capsize critical speed increases dramatically with the
reversed fork.</p>

<h3>Rear weight<a class="headerlink" href="#rear-weight" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another fruitful comparison can be gathered from the Batavus Browser as we
measured both the instrumented configuration and the factory version. The
fundamental difference in the two configuration is that the instrumented
version has a large weight atop the rear rack. Bicycle tourists are some of the
first to mention the effects on handling due to weight on the front and rear
racks of a bicycle, so this comparison examines that to some degree.
<a class="reference internal" href="#figbrowsercompare"><em>Figure 12</em></a> once again shows the root locus with
respect to speed for the two bicycles. The second bifurcation points for the
second oscillatory mode are affected and the weave critical speed is slightly
lower for the factory version. If a rider is added, <a class="reference internal" href="#figbrowserridercompare"><em>Figure 13</em></a>, shows that the added rear weight makes little
difference in the linear dynamics.</p>

<h2>Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I had intended to calculate the uncertainty in the eigenvalue predictions based
on the error propagation from the raw measurements, but I never quite figured
it out. It would be interesting to draw error bars on around the modes in the
eigenvalue plots with respect to the uncertainty values presented in Chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="physicalparameters.html#physicalparameters"><em>Physical Parameters</em></a>. I think it maybe revealing with respect to the
experiments that are done which try to estimate the eigenvalues of a stable
bicycle [Kooijman2008], [Kooijman2009], [Stevens2009], [Escalona2010]. All
of the these experiments, except for [Kooijman2009], plot a predicted
eigenvalue for a speed range because the uncontrolled bicycle does not have way
of maintaining a specific forward speed, but beyond that the uncertainty in the
eigenvalue estimates are not reported. It would be interesting to account for the
uncertainties in both methods of predicting the eigenvalues. Because the
eigenvalues seem to be rather sensitive to change in some parameters, the may
be an important issue to address.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="frequency-response">
<h2>Frequency Response<a class="headerlink" href="#frequency-response" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The eigenvalues give a complete view of the linear systems open loop dynamics,
but one can also examine the system&#8217;s response to various inputs. The frequency
response is good way to examine how the system responds to a sinusoidal input.
The transfer function from steer torque to the roll rate of a bicycle is
particularly interesting because it captures what the essential steering action
needed to induce a turn.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#figbodespeeds"><em>Figure 14</em></a> shows the transfer function for Jason seated on the
Browser for several different speeds. The speeds correspond to before the first
weave bifurcation, unstable weave, stable speed range and unstable capsize. The
roll rate amplitudes somewhat increase with speed, with the 6 m/s showing
larger output amplitudes than the more well damped 10 m/s. The phase plot shows
similarity in the higher speeds and similarity in the lower speeds.  Both plots
show differences at lower frequencies and seem to tend to the same response at
higher frequencies.</p>

stable, while the heavy bikes weave mode is well damped and unstable. Once
again, differences in the frequency response are less apparent at high
frequencies.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Parameter studies can reveal allow one to explore the effects of design
parameters on the system dynamics. The eigenvalue provide a way to transform of
the parameters of a complex system into a minimum characteristic set of
parameters that completely characterize the open loop input ignorant dynamics.
And other views such as the frequency response provide input/output
characteristics of the system&#8217;s transfer functions. System stability, time to
double/half, natural frequency, and frequency responses are all important
characteristics of the system. There are most likely correlations from the open
loop dynamics to handling, as has been demonstrated in aircraft control
literature, but those correlations are mostly speculation and anecdotal at this
point.</p>
<p>For basic diamond frame bicycle, large changes in parameters seem to be needed
for large changes in the dynamics. Most bicycle design parameters are such that
they are within a tight bound in dynamic behavior and differences may not be
readily detectable by the human. Even if they are, we are extremely adaptable
to minor bicycle design variations in term of controllability and handling.
This seems evident even in the front end geometry such as trail, which
countless debates have ensued over the effect of this parameter. Negative trail
recumbent have been designed and the rider can learn ride them, but they
provide a higher learning curve, see the Python Lowracer for an example. These
bikes can often be easily ridden with no hands. With this in mind, most
bicycles don&#8217;t really vary much, but this surely doesn&#8217;t include tandems, large
two wheel cargo bicycles, recumbent designs, etc. And not to mention the
differences in dynamics from a riderless bicycle one with a rigid rider.
Parameter studies may let us find bicycle designs that don&#8217;t fit the normal
mold but may still have good handling, see [Kooijman2011] for some examples of
exploring the extremes of the parameter space.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve shown some qualitative comparisons for real and realistic bicycles. I
believe that the open loop weave eigenvalue and the critical speed (if there is
one) does have correlation to what a rider feels when riding a bicycle.
Everyone can agree that balance is more difficult when starting up than we
cruising at speed. The dynamics show that the system becomes more stable and
more controllable (in the control system&#8217;s sense) as the speed increases. The
weave eigenvalue and critical speed can probably be a good indicator of
stability of normal bicycle designs.</p>
